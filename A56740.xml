            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE PREFACE of the Publiſher.</head>
            <p>THe Tranſlatour of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Book of Communion under both Species, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told us why he made choice of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whom he ſtiles, <hi>The Treaſury of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Fountain of Eloquence, the Oracle of his Age, and in brief, to ſpeak all in a word, the Great</hi> James, <hi>formerly Biſhop of</hi> Condom, <hi>now of</hi> Meaux: Having thus brought forth this great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he makes a plain Challenge with him to us of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>If this Author write Reaſon, he deſerves to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; if otherwiſe, he deſerves to be confuted:</hi> By this I perceived he expected that we ſhould be ſo civil as to take notice of ſo great a Man as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> or any thing that bears his Name, and not let it paſs unregarded by us, after it was <hi>for our benefit,</hi> as he tell us, <hi>made Engliſh:</hi> and beſides, I did not know but ſome unwary perſons among us might <hi>believe the reaſon</hi> he writes however bad; and therefore I thought he deſerved to be confuted, and ought by no means to go without the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and complement of an
<hi>Engliſh Anſwer.</hi> This I doubt not might have been very well ſpared, had the Publiſher been pleaſed to have gone on a little further with his Work of Tranſlating, and obliged us, who are ſtrangers to the
<hi>French</hi> Tongue, with one of thoſe Anſwers which are made to <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Book in that Language, but ſince he has<pb facs="tcp:56128:3"/>not thought fit to do that, I must deſire him to accept of ſuch Entertainment as our Country will afford him, though it is ſomething hard, that we must not only treat our Friends at home, but have as many Strangers as they pleaſe put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: But we who cannot Tranſlate ſo well as others, which is a much eaſier part than to Write at ones own charge, must beg leave of our
<hi>French</hi> Adverſaries, if we ſometimes ſpeak to them in plain
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> must excuſe me if Truth has ſometimes made me otherwiſe anſwer him, then if I were a
<hi>Curé</hi> in his own Dioceſs. Whoever has ſo great an opinion of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Vertue and Learning, as to take matter of Fact upon his word, which the Tranſlatour's mighty Commendations were deſigned, no doubt, to beget in his Reader, must believe the Communion in One Kind was the Practice of the Primitive and the Catholic Church, which if it were true, would be a very great, if not ſufficient excuſe for the <hi>Roman.</hi> This the Biſhop aſſerts with all the confidence in the World, and this his Book is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to make out; and whoever will not believe it, must neceſſarily queſtion either the <hi>Learning</hi> of this great Man, or elſe his <hi>Sincerity;</hi> I ſhall not dare to do the former, but his late <hi>Paſtoral Letter</hi> has given too much reaſon to ſuſpect the latter. He that can now tell the World, That there has been no Perſecution in
<hi>France,</hi> and that <hi>none has ſuffered vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence either in their Perſons or their Eſtates</hi> there, for their Religion; may be allowed to ſay, That the Primitive Church had the Communion but in one Kind, a great while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go: But the one of theſe matters of Fact deſerves more, I think, to be confuted than the other.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it was for the ſake of the Author that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatour choſe this ſubject of Communion in One kind, though he ſays, <hi>It is a point peradventure of higher concern than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other now in debate between Papiſts and Proteſtants,</hi> this <hi>being the main Stone of Offence and Rock of Scandal, and it having been always regarded ſince the Reformation, as a mighty eye-ſore, and alledged as one ſufficient Cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:56128:3"/>of a voluntary departure and ſeparation from the Pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent Church of</hi> Rome. When this <hi>Pre-exiſtent</hi> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fell into her Corrupt, Terreſtrial, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian State, among other Corruptions, this was one that gave just offence, and was together with many more, the Cauſe of our ſeparating from it, That it gave the Eucharist but in one kind, contrary to Christ's Inſtitution, and took away the Cup of Christ's precious Bloud from the People: But yet <hi>this point of higheſt concern</hi> is, <hi>in the judgement</hi> of the Tranſlatour, <hi>but a bare Ceremony, and upon the whole matter the difference herein between the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and the</hi> Roman, <hi>ſeems to him reducible in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to meer Form and Ceremony.</hi> If it be, then I hope it may be eaſily compromized and agreed, for I aſſure him I am as little as he
<hi>for making wider Diviſions, already too great; nor do I approve of the Spirit of thoſe who tear Chriſt's ſeamleſs Garment</hi> for a meer Form and Ceremony; but we who are ſometimes thought fit to be called Heretics, and to be Cenſured and Anathematized as differing in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential matters from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> at other times are made ſuch good Friends to it, that we differ but very little, and there is nothing but <hi>Form and Ceremony</hi> between us: But what is to Accomodate this matter, and Reconcile this difference between the two Churches? Why, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Real Preſence, in which, <hi>Both Churches,</hi> he ſays, <hi>agree, that Chriſt our Saviour is truly, really, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea, and ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament.</hi> This is to cloſe up the difference not onely of Communion in one kind, but of the Adoration of the Sacrament, and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Maſs too in the Tranſlatour's judgement: But does the Church of <hi>England</hi> then agree with the <hi>Roman</hi> in the Real Preſence of Christ's natural Body and Bloud in the Sacrament? Does it not expreſly ſay the contrary, namely, <hi>That the natural Body and Bloud of our Saviour Chriſt are in Heaven and not here,</hi> and that <hi>it is againſt the truth of Chriſt's natural Body to be at one time in more<pb facs="tcp:56128:4"/>places than one</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rubric af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Office of Communion.</note>. So that though Christ be really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by his Spirit and the real Vertue and Efficacy of his Body and Bloud, be given in the Sacrament, yet his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body is by no means preſent there, either by Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation or <hi>by any other way unintelligible to us,</hi> as the Tranſlatour would inſinuate; ſo that all thoſe conſequences which he or others would willingly draw from the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Christ's natural Body in the Sacrament, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, do fall to the ground; and I doubt he or I ſhall never be ſo happy as to make up this great breach between the two Churches, however willing we may be to do it; but inſtead of making a Reconciliation between them, which is impoſſible as long as the Doctrines of each of them ſtand as they do; I ſhall endeavour to defend that Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which not onely <hi>Modern Novelliſts,</hi> as the Tranſlatour calls thoſe who are not for his Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and his Reconciling way; but <hi>the moſt learned and ancient Proteſtants</hi> who have been either Biſhops, Prieſts, or Deacons in our Church, have owned and ſubſcribed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That the Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people, for both the parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Chriſt's Ordinance and Commandment, ought to be miniſtred to all Chriſtian Men</hi>

217.</note>. I ſuppoſe he means, that is, in difference between the Reformed and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> it is indeed ſuch a Caſe as brings almoſt all other matters between us to an iſſue; namely to this Point, Whether the Church may give a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to the Laws of Chriſt, and make other Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his, by vertue of its own Power and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? If it may in this caſe, it may in all others, and therefore it is the more conſiderable Queſtion, becauſe a great many others depend upon the Reſolution of it: When it had been thus determined in the Council of
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> yet a great many were ſo diſ-ſatisfied, namely, the
<hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> to have the Cup taken from them, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of
<hi>Baſil</hi> was forced, upon their importunity, to grant it them again; and at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it was moſt earneſtly preſt by the
<hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> by the Embaſſadors of thoſe Nations, and by the Biſhops, that<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56128:5"/>the People might have the Cup reſtored to them. The truth in this cauſe, and the advantage ſeems to be ſo plain on the ſide of the Reformation, that as it required great Authority to bear it down, ſo it calls for the greateſt Art and Sophiſtry plauſibly to oppoſe it: One would think the caſe were ſo evident, that it were needleſs to ſay much for it, and impoſſible to ſay any thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable againſt it; but it is ſome mens excellency to ſhew their skill in a bad cauſe, and Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has choſen that Province, to make an experiment of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Wit and Learning, and to let us ſee how far thoſe will go to perplex and intangle the cleareſt Truth: He has mixt a great deal of boldneſs with thoſe as it was neceſſary for him, when he would pretend that Communion in one kind was the Practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, and that it was as effectual as in both, and that the Cup did not belong to the ſubſtance of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but was wholly indifferent to the Sacrament, and might be uſed or not uſed as the Church thought fit: How horribly falſe and erronious thoſe Pleas of his are, the following Diſcourſe will ſufficiently make out; and though he has ſaid as much, and with as much-arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and ſubtilty as is poſſible in this cauſe, yet there being another Writer later then him

<hi>Meaux,</hi> whoſe great name and exploits are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-where famous and renowned; but ſince we have all Chriſtian Churches in the World, except the
<hi>Roman,</hi> to be our ſeconds in this Cauſe, we ſhall not fear to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them and our ſelves, and ſo plain a Truth againſt all the cunning and Sophiſtry of our Adverſaries, though it be never ſo artificially, and dreſt after the <hi>French</hi> Mode.</p>
            <p>We will begin with Scripture, which ought to be our onely Rule, not onely in matters of Faith, which ſhould be founded upon nothing leſs than a Divine Revelation, but in matters of pure poſitive and arbitrary Inſtitution, as the Sacraments are; for they depend merely upon the will and pleaſure, the mind and intention of him that appointed them; and the beſt, and indeed the onely way to know that, is, by recurring to his own Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; as we know the mind of a Teſtator by going to his laſt Will and Teſtament, and by conſulting that, do beſt find how he has ordered thoſe things that were of his own free and arbitrary diſpoſal. And by this way we ſhall find, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by taking away the Cup, has plainly violated the Inſtitution of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, and deprived the People of a conſiderable part of that Legacy which he bequeathed to them. Let us lay therefore before us the Inſtitution of our Saviour, as we find it in the three Evangeliſts, and-in St. <hi>Paul</hi> as he <hi>received it of the Lord.</hi>

            <p>From all theſe it evidently appears, that our Saviour appoints the <hi>Cup</hi> as well as the <hi>Bread,</hi> and commands <hi>that</hi> to be <hi>drunk</hi> as much as the <hi>other</hi> to be <hi>eat:</hi> And two of the Evangeliſts remark that particularly of the Cup, which they do not of the Bread, that they <hi>all</hi> drank of it, and that Chriſt ſaid expreſly to them, <hi>Drink ye all of it:</hi> As if the infinite Wiſdom of God which foreſaw all future events, and all the after-errours that ſhould ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Sacrament, had had ſome eſpecial regard to this very thing, and deſigned to prevent the abuſe and miſtake of thoſe who would not have all Chriſtians drink of this Cup, as well as eat of the Bread. What other reaſon there ſhould be of thoſe particular and remarkable words in St.
<hi>Mathew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> relating to the Cup more than to the Bread; I believe it will be hard to find out, for Chriſt gave them the Bread juſt as he did the Cup, and there was no more danger that any of them at that time ſhould omit drinking the one, any more than eating the other; nor did there need any greater caution that we know of, or more particular command
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56128:6"/>in reference to themſelves for the one more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet no doubt there was ſome great and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reaſon for St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s adding of thoſe words, of which there can be no ſuch probable account given, as their having a reſpect and relation to after Ages, as many other things in the Scripture have, which was written for the uſe, not onely of the preſent, but all times of the Church; and if theſe were ſpoken to the Apoſtles onely as Prieſts, as the
<hi>Roman</hi> Sophiſters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, though without any ground, as we ſhall ſhew by and by, there cannot then be given any reaſon for them <hi>as yet,</hi> for there is no ſuch corruption <hi>yet</hi> got into any part of the Chriſtian Church, as to forbid the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to drink of the Cup; and therefore it cannot be ſaid that this remark or precaution was upon their account, unleſs the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will think fit to take it to themſelves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their not allowing their <hi>very Prieſts</hi> to Communicate of the Cup, unleſs when they Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Conſecrate; and ſo will have it regard onely that other abuſe of theirs which is unjuſtifiable, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own grounds, to wit, That the aſſiſtent Prieſts are not to receive it, though Chriſt by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſaid to the Prieſts who were preſent, <hi>Drink ye all of it:</hi> Which is the beſt way that I know, for them to come off of thoſe words by their own Principles. For to avoid the force of thoſe words, and to elude the plain Command and Inſtitution of our Saviour, about the Cup's being given to all Chriſtians, they ſay, The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles received it onely in the capacity of Prieſts; and that our Saviour's Command, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> belongs onely to Prieſts, and was given to the Apoſtles meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſuch; nay, Monſieur <hi>Boileau</hi> ſays,

               <hi>de Meaux</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">P. 237.</note> that <hi>theſe words were addreſſed to the Apoſtles onely who were preſent, and had their entire accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, when in effect they all drunk of it.</hi> Then it ſeems none but the Apoſtles themſelves, no other Prieſts have a right or a command to drink of the Cup, but onely the Apoſtles: And this they might ſay if they pleaſed, upon as good grounds, and defend with as much reaſon, as that the Apoſtles onely drank of it as Prieſts; but I ſuppoſe they do not intend to improve this notion ſo far, but mean onely the ſame with their Brethren who ſay, that thoſe words concern the Apoſtles, not onely in their own perſons, but as Prieſts, and as bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſons of all Chriſtian Prieſts, in which capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city alone they received the Cup and were commanded by our Saviour to drink of it; whereas they received the Bread as Lay-men, and as repreſenting the whole body of private and ordinary Chriſtians. What a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change is here in the Apoſtles! they who ſat down as Lay-men, and as Lay-men took the Bread juſt before, have their capacity altered in a trice, and are made Prieſts in a moment: Yes, ſay they, ſo they were, at that very time they were made Prieſts, whilſt they were ſitting at Table with Chriſt, and Celebrating this his laſt Supper; the firſt and only ordination that ever was, either in the Jewiſh or Chriſtian Church, in the time of eating and ſiting at Table. And they may ſet up, I dare ſay, for the firſt Authors among all the Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that ever were of this Opinion that is now held by them; That Chriſt at his laſt Supper appointed not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, but two Sacraments; that of Orders as well as that of the Euchariſt; and the firſt without any proper Solemnity for ſuch a purpoſe, without any outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or any Words, one would think, importing any ſuch thing: But they were made Prieſts, ſay they, by vertue of thoſe words. <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> Do this; which Chriſt ſpake to them after he had given them the Bread. This<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56128:7"/>is a very ſhort and a quick form of Ordination; and had it been known to be one ſooner, for 'tis a very late diſcovery, I ſuppoſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church would have kept to that in the Ordaining Prieſts, as they do to <hi>Hoc est Corpus,</hi> in Conſecrating the Sacramental Bread: But this ſhort form whereby they will have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles made Preiſts ſo ſuddenly and unexpectedly, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be too quick, and to make them Prieſts a little too ſoon, which is a very unlucky thing for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for Chriſt ſaid thoſe words,
<hi>Hoc facite,</hi> do this; juſt as he gave them the Bread, and ſpoke them in one continued ſentence, with, <hi>Take, eat: this is my body;</hi> ſo that whether he gave the Bread ſeverally to each of them, or they took it as it was upon the table, as it is ſaid, <hi>they divided the Cup among themſelves;</hi> it cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but that thoſe words <hi>hoc facite</hi> were ſpoken by Chriſt, before the Apoſtles did receive the Bread, or at leaſt before they ate it; ſo that it might as fairly be pretended, and as truly, that the Apoſtles ate the Bread as Prieſts, as well as drank the Wine as ſuch; for they were made as much Prieſts by thoſe words, before they ate the Bread, as before they drank the Wine: If we do ſuppoſe they did receive the Bread into their hands, before thoſe words were pronounced by our Saviour; which is the moſt that can be, yet they could not eat it before they were. And ſo this fine and ſubtle Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis which they have invented to deprive the Laiety of the Cup, will deprive them of the Bread too, and will in its conſequence, and by the ſame train of arguing, tend to take away the whole Sacrament from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and make it peculiar to the Prieſts, as ſome of the Jewiſh Sacrifices were, and the People ſhall not at all partake of the Altar, but it ſhall be reſerved as a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar right and priviledge of the Prieſts, to which the Laity ought not to pretend, becauſe the Apoſtles took the Sacrament only as Prieſts, and were made Prieſts<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56128:8"/>fore they either ate the Bread or drank the Wine; this would make a greater difference and diſtinction between the Prieſts and the Laiety, and tend more to preſerve the honour and eſteem of one above the other. Which is the great reaſon they themſelves give, and no doubt a true one, for their taking away the Cup from the People; and I don't queſtion, but ſo great a Wit, and ſo elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent an Artiſt in pleading, as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> is, who can ſay a great deal for any cauſe, be it never ſo bad, may with as good grounds, and as great a ſhew of reaſon, juſtifie if he pleaſe, the taking away the whole Sacrament from the Laiety as the Cup, and may to this purpoſe improve and advance this notion of the Apoſtles, receiving both kinds as Prieſts, to prove the Laiety have a right to neither, and may take off the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of both parts as well as one, by pretending that the real effect and vertue of the Sacrament is received ſome other way, by the Sacrifice of the Maſs, or by Spiritual Manducation, or by ſome thing elſe without partaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Symbols, as well as without partaking all of them as Chriſt has appointed, for if the effect and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrament depend upon Chriſts Inſtitution, then both are neceſſary, if it may be had without keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, then neither is ſo, but of this afterwards, when we come to examine his grounds and reaſons. I ſhall make ſome Reflections upon our Saviours Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament, and offer ſome conſiderations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe pretences and Sophiſtries of our Adverſaries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would ask them whither thoſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> do not belong to all Chriſtians as well as to the Apoſtles? if they do not, then where is there any command given to Chriſtians for to receive the Sacrament, either in both or in one kind? Where is there any command at all for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to Celebrate or come to the Lords Supper? or to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Chriſtian Rite, which is the peculiar mark and<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56128:8"/>badge of our Profeſſion, and the moſt ſolemn part of Chriſtian Worſhip? Thoſe words ſurely contain in them as plain a Command, and as direct an Obligation upon all Chriſtians to perform this Duty to the end of the World, as they did upon the Apoſtles at that time; or elſe we muſt ſay with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> That the Sacrament was onely a temporary Rite, that belonged onely to the Apoſtles, and was not to continue in the Church, or be obſerved by all Chriſtians in all Ages: But St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26.</note> we <hi>do hereby ſhew, or declare the Lord's death till he come,</hi> by this ſolemn way of eating Bread broken, and Wine poured out; we are to remember Chriſt who dyed for us, and is gone into Heaven, till he come again, when we ſhall live with him, and enjoy his Preſence for ever: Chriſt has given a command to all Chriſtians to do this, and they are to <hi>Do this in remembrance of him;</hi> they are as much obliged to this, as the Apoſtles were; and the command does as much belong to the People, to receive the Sacrament, as to the Apoſtles, or to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to give it them. The Apoſtles and Chriſtian Prieſts are hereby commanded to do their parts, which is, not onely to receive, but to diſpence and diſtribute the Sacrament; and the People or Chriſtian Laiety, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do theirs, which is, to receive it: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles are to do that which Chriſt did, to Bleſs the Bread and breake it, and give it to be eaten; to bleſs the Cup, and give it to be drunk by the Communicants; and the Communicants are to eat the Bread and drink the Cup: and if they do not both of them do this that belongs to them, and perform thoſe proper parts of their Duty, which are here commanded them, they are both guilty of an unexcuſable diſobedience to this plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> No body ever denyed that thoſe words, and this command of Chriſt, belonged to the Apoſtles; but to ſay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them alone, and not to all Chriſtians, is to take
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56128:9"/>away the Command and Obligation which all Chriſtians have to receive the Holy Supper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This command of Chriſt, as it obliges all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to receive the Sacrament, the Laiety as well as the Clergy, ſo it obliges them to receive it in both kinds; and as it obliges the Clergy to give the People the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo it obliges them to give it in both kinds; for the command of <hi>Doing this in remembrance of Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs as much to one kind as the other; and is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly added concerning the Cup, as concerning the Bread; for ſo it is in St. <hi>Paul</hi> ‖ beyond all contradiction, and to the unanſwerable confuſion of our Adverſaries, who would pretend it belongs only to the Bread; <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> obſerving theſe words in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> to be added only after the giving of the Bread, for they are in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two other Evangeliſts, falls into a mighty tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and into a moſt Religious fit of Catholic Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, admiring the wonderful Providence of GOD,

<hi>Meaux</hi> eſpied this,

<note n="‖" place="margin">P. 256.</note> and when we do ſo, we are to receive it as Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded we ſhould, by eating Bread, and drinking Wine, and <hi>doing both thoſe in remembrance of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt's own Inſtitution, had there been no ſuch particular Commands to Drink, as well as to Eat, and to <hi>Do both in remembrance of him;</hi> I ſay, his own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, both by Bread and Wine, ſhould ſuffice, methinks, to ſhow us what we ſhould do, when we Celebrate the ſame Sacrament that he did; namely,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56128:10"/>uſe both Bread and Wine; and eat and drink it as was done then; if it be the ſame Sacrament that he celebrated with his Diſciples, why do not we celebrate it as he did? why ſhould we not obſerve his own Inſtitution? but without any order from him, and contrary to what he did, leave out part of it; and that part of it which is as conſiderable and as remarkable in his Inſtitution, as the other? If from the bare Inſtitution of Chriſt, all Chriſtians are bound to receive this Sacrament, which ſurely they are; then from thence they are bound as much to drink the Cup, as to eat the Bread; for both are equally inſtituted.

Which, though it be the moſt preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous boldneſs, and the moſt horrid Sacriledge that can be, yet ſhall I ſay no more to it at preſent, but what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> does upon the like caſe, of thoſe who would omit the Wine in the Sacrament, and uſe water inſtead of it.

He was aware of a difficulty, if the Apoſtles took the Cup onely as Prieſts, and by the right of Prieſts, at the firſt Inſtitution, then it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, to have any but Prieſts receive the Cup: And then, why is it ever given to the Laiety, as it is ſometimes by the Pope's favour and conceſſion; if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to Prieſts, and the Prieſts onely have right to it, from the firſt Inſtitution, becauſe the Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it only as Prieſts? But ſo inconſiſtent are they to their own Principles, that they do not give the Cup, even to their Prieſts, unleſs when they themſelves Conſecrate and Officiate: None but the <hi>Miniſter Conficiens</hi> is to receive that, though never ſo many other Prieſts be by, ſo much at variance are they, between this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and their own practice, and ſo do they fight, even with their own ſhadows; if the Apoſtles received the Cup as Prieſts, Why then do not all Prieſts receive it, as well as the Prieſt who Conſecrates, if onely he that Conſecrates be to receive it, then by this rule, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſhould not have received it at the firſt Inſtitution, for they did not then Conſecrate? Chriſt was then alone, the
<hi>Miniſter Conficiens,</hi> and ſo according to them, he ought onely to have received it, and not the Apoſtles, and yet 'tis moſt probable that Chriſt did not himſelf receive either the Cup, or the Bread, ſo that if they will keep cloſe to this whimſical Notion of theirs, the <hi>Miniſter Conficiens</hi> is not to receive at all, but to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate and give to the other Prieſts that are preſent; but further, if the Apoſtles were made Prieſts by thoſe words, <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> which they ſo earneſtly contend, and ſpend ſo much Critical learning to ſhow that <hi>face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſignifies</hi> to Sacrifice, then they were twice made Prieſts at the ſame time, for thoſe words were ſaid by<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56128:12"/>our Saviour, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> Witneſſes, not onely after gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Bread, but repeated again alſo after the Cup, ſo that the Apoſtles were doubly Conſecrated, and the Character of Prieſts, was twice Imprinted upon them at the ſame time, which is another difficulty with which they muſt be encumbred according to their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for though this Opinion be wholly Imaginary, yet like the Night-mare, 'tis a real weight lying upon them, and I ſhall leave them to ſweat under it, and get it off as well as they can.</p>

Whatever be the effects and benefits which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by partaking of this Bleſſed Sacrament, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Inſtitution of it, and are not ordinarily to be had without obſerving of that; I ſay ordinarily, becauſe Caſes of Neceſſity diſpence with poſitive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as if a ſick man cannot ſwallow the Bread, about which there is a Proviſion in the Eleventh Council of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> if the natural Infirmity of anothers Stomack be ſuch, that he cannot drink Wine, which the French Diſcipline ſpeaks of, and which Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 181.</note> makes an Objection againſt them, if the place be ſuch that no Wine is to be had or procured, as in <hi>Norway</hi> where Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eighth allowed them to Celebrate without Wine; in thoſe extraordinary Caſes, God has not ſo tied the inward Grace to the outward Signe, but that he can give it without it; as if a Catechumen wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous of Baptiſm, die without it, becauſe he could not have it, yet the Church has always ſuppoſed he may have the benefit of it, and ſo I charitably hope that the Pious and Religious Laiety in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall have the benefit of the Blood of Chriſt, though they are deprived of it in the Sacrament, and through the meer fault of their Governours, and of their Prieſts, are excluded from it, and forced to violate the Divine Inſtitution, which is all that <hi>Calixtus</hi> and others which Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 277.</note> is willing to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56128:13"/>of, charitably allow, as not being willing to exclude any one for Salvation, for what he cannot help; but this is no manner of prejudice to the cauſe that we defend, and no excuſe in the World for breaking the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and altering his poſitive precept without any neceſſity, for though God can give the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grace, and no doubt, but he will do it in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caſes without the Sacrament, without either the whole, or any part of it, yet, he will not ordinarily do this, nor is it ordinarily to be had, or to be expected, without keeping to that Inſtitution, by vertue of which, God has annexed, and promiſed ſuch inward vertues, and benefits to ſuch outward ſigns, and holy Symbols, and Ceremonies, which he himſelf has appointed; and therefore, though God, if he had pleaſed, might have annexed the whole vertue and effect of the Sacrament, to the eating the Bread, or to the drinking the Wine alone, or might have given it without either of them, yet he having by the Inſtitution, appointed both parts of the Sacrament, hath annexed the grace and vertue to both, and not to one only. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> will needs have the whole fruit, and vertue, and eſſential effect of the Sacrament, to be given by one ſpecies, which is the great principle he goes upon, which I ſhall more fully examine afterwards, but if the vertue and eſſential ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect depend upon the Inſtitution, and it can depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing elſe, and if both ſpecies be inſtituted by Chriſt, as I have ſhown, then the vertue and effect depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both ſpecies, and not upon one. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> asks. <hi>Whether in the very moment, the Body of our Lord is received, all the effects be not likewiſe received</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 328.</note>? I anſwer No, becauſe all that is required in the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not then received. He farther asks, <hi>Whether the blood can add any thing eſſential?</hi> I anſwer Yes, becauſe that alſo is in the Inſtitution; if one of the Apoſtles had ſtopt our Saviour, when he had given them the Bread,<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56128:13"/>and told them this was his Body, and askt him this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry queſtion, I ask, whither he thinks this would have hindred him from going on with the Cup, becauſe they had already received the whole vertue and effect of the Sacrament without that; and nothing eſſential could be added by that? Chriſt, it ſeems by the Inſtitution, did go on to the Cup, after he had given the other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to ſay, he did not give any eſſential vertue, or efficacy by the Cup, is an unwarrantable boldneſs, and blaſphemous impudence, which may as well deny, that he gave any by the Bread; this is to make the Cup a very empty ſigne, and naked figure, devoid of all inward vertue and efficacy, and to ſerve as <hi>de Meaux</hi> would have it, onely for Repreſentation, and a more full and expreſs Signification<note n="*" place="margin">P. 176.</note>, in which he joyns us to the Cup, with thoſe his Adverſaries, who have the meaneſt thoughts of the Sacrament, and indeed, it is to make the Cup wholly ſuperfluous, and unneceſſary, as to the conveying or exhibiting any real Vertue, or inward Grace, which is to be received thereby, and as Monſieur
<hi>de Meaux</hi> is forced to own, when he anſwers that demand, to what purpoſe then, was the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both ſpecies<note n="‖" place="margin">P. 179.</note>? to make it only a more full Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and Repreſentation of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, but not to give us any of the vertue or efficacy of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> he ſays, <hi>cannot ſeparate the vertue, or effect, that any other Grace ſhould accompany his blood, then the ſame in ground and ſubſtance which accompanys his body</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 182.</note>, but he can make the whole Vertue and Grace accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and depend upon both the Sacramental Body, and Sacramental Blood together, and ſo he has done by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, according to which, the Sacramental Grace is not to be expected ordinarily, without both; but he may deprive thoſe Perſons wholly of this, who violate his Inſtitution, and who receive not both ſpecies, as he has appointed and commanded tehm; which is a very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56128:14"/>conſideration, which ſhould make men afraid to dare to alter any ſuch thing as Chriſt's own Inſtitution, upon which the whole vertue of the Sacraments does depend.</p>
            <p n="7">7. 'Tis from the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, that we know what belongs to the ſubſtance of it, and is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to it, and what is onely circumſtantial and accidental: I own there were ſeveral things, even at the Inſtitution of it by Chriſt, which were onely circumſtantials; as the place where, the time when, the number of perſons, to whom, the poſture in which he gave it; for all theſe are plainly, and in their own nature, circumſtantial matters; ſo that no body can think it neceſſary or eſſential to the Sacrament, that it be Celebrated in an upper Room, at night after Supper, onely with twelve perſons, and thoſe ſitting or lying upon Beds, as the Jews uſed to do at Meals; for the ſame thing which Chriſt bids them do, may be done, the ſame Sacramental Action performed in another place, at another time, with fewer or more perſons, and thoſe otherwiſe poſtured or ſituated; but it cannot be the ſame Sacrament or ſame Action, if Bread be not bleſſed and eaten, if Wine be not bleſſed and drunken, as they were both then bleſſed by Chriſt, and eaten and drunk by his Apoſtles: The doing of theſe is not a circumſtance, but the very thing it ſelf, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſtance and eſſence of the Sacrament; for without theſe we do not do what Chriſt did, whereas we may do the very ſame thing which he did, without any of thoſe circumſtances with which he did it: Thus in the other Sacrament of Baptiſm or waſhing with water, whether that be done by waſhing the whole body in immerſion, or by waſhing a part of the Body in ſprinkling, is but a circumſtance, that is not neceſſary or eſſential to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but to waſh with Water, is the very thing in which Baptiſm conſiſts, and the very ſubſtance of the Sacrament which is eſſential and unalterable; the quantity of Water with which we waſh is not, no more is the quantity of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56128:14"/>Bread and Wine which we eat and drink in the Sacrament but eating Bread and drinking Wine is as eſſential to the Euchariſt, as waſhing with Water is to Baptiſm.

<hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men did this, I ſhall never blame the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any of his Succeſſors for doing it afterwards, and if they did it juſt after they were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and had that in ſuch a Miraclous manner given unto them; I ſhall conclude, it was not the office of that bleſſed Spirit <hi>to bring all things to their remembrance which Christ had ſaid unto them,</hi> as he told them it ſhould be, but to teach them things quite contrary to what he had a little before commanded and appointed them: And it will be more ſtrange if Chriſt himſelf, after his Reſurrection, ſhould give the Sacrament in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then he had done four days before. Let us therefore examine thoſe places from which all theſe ſtrange things are pretended, and ſee if any ſuch matter is to be found in them, which I confeſs, will be very ſurprizing, if they be: As to the firſt, St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 24. That the ſame day Chriſt was riſen, two of the Diſciples, the name of one of which was <hi>Cleophas,</hi> going to
<hi>Emmaus,</hi> a Village near to <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> Chriſt, as they were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning together about him and his Reſurrection, drew near, and went along with them, and diſcourſt to them about thoſe things, as a perſon unknown; and going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Houſe and <hi>ſitting at meat with them, he took bread and bleſſed it, and brake, and gave to them,</hi> v. 30. Here, ſay they, Chriſt gave the Sacrament, and gave it onely in Bread, for <hi>he took bread and bleſſed, and brake, and gave to them;</hi> which are the very words uſed at his giving his laſt Supper: But muſt Chriſt always be ſuppoſed to give the Sacrament whenever <hi>he took bread and bleſſed, and brake it, and gave it to</hi> others? Then he did ſo when he filled the five thouſand with five Loaves and two<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56128:16"/>Fiſhes, for then
<hi>he looked up to heaven and bleſſed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to others,</hi> Mark 6.41. Mat. 14.19. And ſo he did when he filled four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at another time, <hi>he took the ſeven loaves and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his diſciples to ſet before them,</hi> Mark 8.6. Here though he bleſſed the Bread, and gave thanks, as was always the cuſtom of Pious and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, at their ordinary meals, and though he brake the Bread, which is a Jewiſh phraſe for diſtributing and giving it; yet it cannot in the leaſt be pretended, that in any of theſe places he gave the Sacrament, nor is there any manner of reaſon to ſuppoſe he did ſo at <hi>Emmaus,</hi> with theſe Diſciples, but to ſatisfie them of the truth, of himſelf and his Reſurrection; he took meat with them, as he did afterwards with the Eleven Apoſtles, and by his behaviour at Table, and by his form of Bleſſing, which was probably the ſame he uſed at other times, and by thus ſeeing and converſing with him more intimately at Table, they came to underſtand who it was, and <hi>their eyes were opened, and they knew him,</hi> or as is <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>he was known to them in breaking of bread;</hi> that is, in eating with him, not that any thing miraculous or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary was here ſhewn by Chriſt, or wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, any more than was to the Apoſtles afterwards, to whom he ſhewed himſelf likewiſe, and took meat with them, to give them full ſatisfaction, that it was the ſame perſon who was Crucified, and who was riſen with the ſame Body he had before; or if they were illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their eyes open'd in an extraordinary manner at that time; yet it was not neceſſary this ſhould be done by the Sacrament, of all the vertues of which, the opening mens eyes, and curing them of Infidelity, is the leaſt to be aſcribed to it, ſince it is onely to be taken by thoſe who do believe, and whoſe eyes are opened before, though this may ſometimes be applyed to it, by way of Allegory and alluſion, as it is by St. <hi>Auſtine, Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56128:16"/>and others, who make the Pool of <hi>Betheſda;</hi> and the curing of the Lame and the Leprous by a word, to be as much Sacramental as they do this that is to have ſome ſignification or reſemblance to Spiritual things: But there is not one Father or ancient Interpreter, who does plainly affirm, that Chriſt did here give the Sacrament, to thoſe Diſciples at <hi>Emmaus:</hi> The Bread which Chriſt bleſſed, was no more truly made a Sacrament thereby, than the Houſe of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> was dedicated into a Church by Chriſt's preſence and Divine Diſcourſes there; which, yet it might be, according to St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any adminiſtring of the Sacrament, of which that place quoted out of him, makes no mention:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Boileau,</hi> p. 192.</note> But if it muſt be ſuppoſed without any Authority, and without any Reaſon, that Chriſt did here give the Sacrament, it muſt alſo be granted, that he did ſomething more, than is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that ſhort account, which is there given; he muſt not onely have <hi>bleſſed and brake the bread, and given it to them,</hi> but he muſt have done it with thoſe words, <hi>This is my body;</hi> which, they ſay, are always neceſſary to the true Conſecration of this Sacrament: And if he may be ſuppoſed to have uſed thoſe, though they are not mentioned, which is a good argument to prove it was not the Sacrament, but onely an ordinary Meal; then we may as well ſuppoſe, that at the ſame time he uſed Wine too, though that is not mentioned, and though we have no account of any Drink, which yet we cannot but think they had at that Supper let it be what it will: eating together and ſitting at meat, includes and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes drinking too, though there is no particular or expreſs mention of it: As in the</p>

4.4. the ſame is imported. To break Bread, was an uſual Hebrew expreſſion, for giving all manner of food, as appears by thoſe inſtances, ſo that when Bread, which is but one part of food, is expreſſed; yet the other is included and meant alſo, as when Chriſt
<hi>went into the houſe of one of the chief Phariſes to eat bread,</hi> Luke 14.1. we cannot ſuppoſe that he had only ſuch a dry Banquet, as not to drink with him too, and when <hi>Joſeph</hi> told the Steward of his houſe, that he ſhould prepare an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his brethren, <hi>for they are to eat with me at noon,</hi> Gen. 43.16. <hi>hodie ſunt mecum comeſturi,</hi> as in the vulgar, he did not I ſuppoſe, think they were not to drink with him too, and that he was not to provide Wine, as well as other Victuals, neither did <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s own Brethren, ſuſpect he would ſend them away dry and thirſty, when they onely heard that they ſhould <hi>eat bread there v:</hi> 25.

            </p>

               </gap>, and yet when they thus drank to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at their Entertainments, they did no doubt eat too; though, if we will as ſtrictly inſiſt upon the phraſe, and not allow a Synecdoche here, as well as in the Jewiſh one, of breaking or eating Bread, we muſt make their Feaſts to be all of Liquids, and the other all of Solids: But the phraſe is ſo clear and ſo uſual, that nothing could make men deny its being ſo, but their being willing to ſtick to any thing, however weak and little it be, that ſeems in the leaſt to favour a bad cauſe, which is forced to call in the help of a Phraſe, uſed in a ſhort Hiſtory, and that againſt its uſual meaning, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with a plain Command and clear Inſtitution; I would only ask theſe Gentlemen, and Monſi.
<hi>Boileau,</hi> with whom I am eſpecially concerned, whither he does not think the firſt Chriſtians, when they met together to break Bread, allowing thereby, it was to receive the Sacrament, did not alſo at the ſame time feaſt together at their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Which I think, he or any one verſed in Antiquity, will not deny. And if ſo, he muſt either ſay, that at thoſe Love-feaſts they uſed no Wine or Drink, becauſe none is expreſly mentioned here; though it is plain they did in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> even to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; or elſe, that this Jewiſh phraſe of breaking Bread, is to be here taken, as it is in other places, by a Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, for both eating and drinking together, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Lord's Table or at any other.

But he is a bold man, that dare face the mouth of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, who dare undertake to prove the Communion in one kind, out of the eleventh Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> which is ſuch a perfect demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration againſt it, that a man muſt out-face the Sun, who offers at any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as the beſt and trueſt means to correct the abuſes got into the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> about the Euchariſt, recurs to the Inſtitution which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Chriſt himſelf, and which he delivered to the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> in which there is ſo full an account of both the ſpecies, and ſuch a command of both, as is ſufficient to ſhew the Apoſtolical practice confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and to let us ſee what Tradition they left in their Churches about it. Had there been any difference between the Prieſts and the Peoples receiving the Bread and Wine; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who wrote to the Laiety, would no doubt have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and told them their reſpective duties; but he delivers the Inſtitution to them, juſt as Chriſt did to his Apoſtles; ſays not a tittle of their not being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Cup, but on the contrary, adds that command to it, which is in none of the Evangeliſts,
<hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> Gives not the leaſt intimation, that this was given to the Apoſtles as Prieſts, or that they were made Prieſts then; but what is obſervable, does not ſo much as mention the Apoſtles, or take any notice of the perſons that were preſent at the Inſtitution, and to whom the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> were ſpoken. So, that ſo far as appears from him, they might be ſpoken to other Diſciples, to ordinary Laics; nay, to the women who might be preſent at this firſt Sacrament, as well as the Apoſtles; and ſo muſt have been made Prieſts by thoſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56128:19"/>words, <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> as well as they. After the recital of the Inſtitution, in which he obſerves no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prieſts and Laics; he tells the Faithful of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that as often as they did eat this Bread and drink this Cup, <hi>they ſhewed forth the Lord's death, till he come:</hi> So that they who were to ſhew forth Chriſt's death, as well as the Prieſts, were to do it both by eating the Bread and drinking the Cup; and, indeed, one of them does not ſhew forth his death ſo well as both; for it does not ſhew his Blood ſeparated from his Body. He goes on to ſhew'um the guilt of unworthy eating and drinking, for he all along joyns both thoſe Acts, as a phraſe, ſignifying the Communion; and he expreſly uſes it no leſs than four times in that Chapter: But in ſome Copies, ſay they, inſtead of <hi>and,</hi> he uſes the particle <hi>or,</hi> in the 27 <hi>v. Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread, or drink this cup unworthily:</hi> and here Monſieur <hi>Boileau</hi> would gladly find ſomething for either Eating or Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without doing both; which is ſuch a ſhift and cavil, as nothing would make a man catch at, but ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate cauſe as has nothing elſe to be ſaid for it: If the particle <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>and,</hi> yet he has but little skil either in <hi>Greek</hi> or
<hi>Latine</hi> Authors, who knows not that it is the commoneſt thing in both, to uſe that diſjunctive for a copulative; as, <hi>to Abraham or his ſeed,</hi> for <hi>to Abraham and his ſeed</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Ro. 4.13.</note>: Of which it were eaſie to give innumerable inſtances, both in the <hi>Bible</hi> and profane Hiſtory: The Apoſtle having uſed the copulative in all other Verſes, and all along in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and having joyned eating and drinking, cannot be ſuppoſed here to uſe a disjunctive, and to ſeparate them; but after all, there are Copies of as great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Authority for the particle

               </gap>, though I think no ſuch weight bears upon the difference of theſe particles, as to make it worth our while to examine them; for if the Apoſtles did disjoyn them, it was onely
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56128:19"/>to lay a greater Emphaſis upon the guilt of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy eating and drinking, which though they both go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet are both very great Sins; and I ſee no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conſequence, that becauſe a man may both eat and drink unworthily, that therefore he ſhould onely eat, and not drink at all; or that the Apoſtles ſuppoſed it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat without drinking, or drink without eating.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtolical practice, and the Inſtitution of our Saviour, for Communion in both kinds, though it be very plain and clear in Scripture, and being founded upon ſo full a Command, and a Divine Inſtitution; I know no Power in the Church to alter it, or vary from it; yet it will be further confirmed, and ſtrengthened by the Univerſal Practice of the whole Chriſtian Church, and of the pureſt Ages after the Apoſtles, and by the general conſent of Antiquity, for a thouſand years and more after Chriſt; in which I ſhall prove the Euchariſt was always given to all the Faithful, who came to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip; and to the Communion in both kinds, without any difference made between the Prieſts and the Laiety, as to this matter, which was a thing never heard of in Antiquity, nor ever ſo much as mentioned in any Author, till after the Twelfth Century; in which wretched times of Ignorance and Superſtition, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation being newly brought in, ſtruck men with ſuch horror, and Superſtitious Reverence of the ſacred Symbols, which they believed to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the very ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body and Blood; that they begun to be afraid of taking that part which was fluid and might be ſpilt, each drop of which they thought to be the ſame blood that flowed out of the ſide of Chriſt, and the very ſubſtantial Blood that was running in his Veins, and now by a miraculous way, was conveyed into the Chalice. Hence at firſt, they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Pipes and Quils to ſuck it out of the Cup, and ſome uſed intinction or dipping of the Bread in the Wine;<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56128:20"/>and afterwards the ſame ſuperſtition increaſing, they came to leave off, and abſtaine wholly from drinking the Cup; which was reſerved onely to the more ſacred lips of the Prieſts, who were willing to be hereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from the more unworthy and prophane Laie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Council of

<hi>Julius,</hi> to have been the manner of ſome, who though they were very blameable, and juſtly cenſured for ſo doing; yet they hereby confeſt, that there ought to be two ſpecies given in the Sacrament, a liquid one, as well as a ſolid: The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and the <hi>Manichees,</hi> are the onely Chriſtians that ever thought otherwiſe. When the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation began to creep into the Church, in the time of
<hi>Berengarius,</hi> and ſome Chriſtians were thereupon poſſeſt with a greater fear of ſpilling the Blood of Chriſt; they did not however at firſt leave drinking the Cup for that reaſon, but they brought in another cuſtom to prevent ſpilling; which was, to faſten little Pipes or Quills to the Chalices they then uſed, and through them to ſuck the conſecrated Wine: This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the order of Celebrating Maſs by the Pope, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of ſeveral Books of the <hi>Ordo Romanus,</hi> in <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s Lyturgics, <hi>The Arch-deaconreceives of the Regionary Sub-deacon a Pugillaris, with which he confirms the people</hi>

I need not produce witneſſes to prove this, the matter of Fact is plain and undeniable, and none of their Writers can, or do pretend the contrary as to public and general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion concerning any Chriſtians, except thoſe few that they have lately brought over by their well-known Arts, to ſubmit to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as the <hi>Maronites</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas:</hi> All the other vaſt number of Chriſtians over all the World, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> the

               <hi>Will any one deny this uſe of the Euchariſtic Communion to have been in both kinds, in the times of the Apoſtles? And that it continued in the Church many Ages after?

            </p>
            <p>And now having given ſo full a proof that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kinds, was the Practice of the Primitive Church, which I have done ſo largely, becauſe Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has the face to deny this, and to attempt to prove the contrary; it will be very ſtrange if after ſo many Affirmative Evidences, who all unanimouſly and poſitively declare that the Communion was always in both kinds, there ſhould be any Negative Teſtimonies produced to the contrary, who ſhall fully contradict theſe, and depoſe that it was very often the cuſtom of the Church to Communicate but in one. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has made it his buſineſs to do this, and brings ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inſtances out of Antiquity to ſhew, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was very frequently given in the Primitive Church but in one kind, as <hi>in the Communion of the Sick, the Communion of Infants, Domeſtic Communion,</hi> and which, as he tells us, is very ſurprizing, <hi>the Public Communion in the Church.</hi> If he can but make out one of theſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, to wit, the latter, that of Public Communion in<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56128:33"/>the Church, it will be much more conſiderable than all his other; for if they ſhould prove true, namely, that in particular and extraordinary caſes of neceſſity, to which we know all poſitive precepts are to give way; the Communion was given but in one kind to thoſe who were uncapable to receive both, as to ſick Perſons and Children, or that in times of Perſecution Chriſtians did carry home onely the Bread with them, that ſo they might eat it in private, when they could not ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently carry home the Wine; What will this ſignifie to the juſtifying the Conſtant and Public Communions in one kind, when there are no ſuch particular or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reaſons for it, and the eſtabliſhing this by a Law, as a ſtanding and neceſſary Practice to be obſerved by the whole Church? The doing this, is as if the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe whilſt they were in the Wilderneſs they could not ſo well obſerve the Precept of Circumciſion, and ſo were at that time for a particular reaſon excuſed from it, ſhould ever after have omitted it as unneceſſary, and have thought fit at laſt to forbid it by a Law of their <hi>Sanhedrim:</hi> This ſure had been making too bold with a poſitive Precept, although there might be a particular caſe or inſtance wherein it was not ſo exactly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: Every Chriſtian is obliged to have and to read the Word of God, notwithſtanding that there may be inſtances of ſome who are Dumb or Blind, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable and ſo excuſed from thoſe otherwiſe neceſſary duties, as the Sick and the Captives, and the Deaf are, from coming to Public Prayers and Public Worſhip; and where there are the like particular exceptions, and as particular reaſons for not receiving the Sacrament in both kinds, as in the Sick, and Infants, who cannot ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Bread, the <hi>Abſtemii,</hi> who naturally abhor Wine and the like, there without any derogating to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of Chriſt, they may be diſpenſed withal by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that neceſſity, which takes away the obligation of<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56128:34"/>all poſitive Laws; but it will not at all follow from hence, that the Law does not oblige in all other caſes. If Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> therefore could prove, as he offers to do, but upon what falſe, or at leaſt dubious grounds, I ſhall conſider by and by, that the Sick and Infants who could not ſwallow the Bread did receive onely the Wine; and that in the times of Perſecution when they could not come ſo often to the public Communion, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated at home onely of that Bread which they could carry away and keep ſafely by them, when they could not ſo well either keep or carry away the Wine; this will by no means juſtifie the ſingle Communion to all perſons, and at all other times, when there is no ſuch particular neceſſity or extraordinary reaſon for it: Though they might in thoſe caſes hope for the benefit of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and not doubt but that God would beſtow it upon them, though they received but in one kind, when they could not receive both, yet there is not the ſame reaſon to expect it at other times when we may, and ſo are obliged to both; as the <hi>Jews</hi> whilſt in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might hope to enjoy all the benefits of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and being in Covenant with God, though they did not then obſerve the Law and Inſtitution of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but this they could not expect, but would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have forfeited, if they did not punctually obſerve it afterwards as it was commanded them.</p>
            <p>And as for the two inſtances he brings of Public Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Church in one kind, as on <hi>Good-Friday</hi> in the <hi>Latine</hi> Church, and all <hi>Lent</hi> in the <hi>Maſs of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified,</hi> in the <hi>Greek,</hi> were thoſe true, as I ſhall ſhew they are not, but that both Species were uſed in both thoſe Communions, yet they being ſuch Communions as were particular to thoſe days, and remarkably diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Communions at all other times of the year, would plainly prove, that the ordinary and uſual Communions upon all other other days, and at all other
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56128:34"/>times, were conſtantly in both kinds in the
<hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Church: If they were not, why are theſe pickt out by him as <hi>ſingle Inſtances</hi> of Communions in one kind? By this he plainly acknowledges, that theſe differed from the <hi>ſtated</hi> and <hi>conſtant Communions,</hi> and ſo confeſſes that
<hi>thoſe</hi> were in both kinds: And though he ventures to ſay, that in the ordinary Office the Church received ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both ſpecies, or one onely; yet this is ſo wholly without any ſhadow of proof, that I wonder he would expoſe the credit of his learning, or his honeſty upon ſo notorious a falſhood, that has not the leaſt Fig-leave to cover its ſhame; for as to the decrees of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> againſt Communicating in one kind, to make theſe an Argument for it, is a piece of ſuch refined art and skill, as no body but <hi>de Meaux</hi> could have found out or made uſe of; but becauſe the ſtrength of his Book lies upon the truth of theſe Inſtances of his, though I think that be already ſhaken, yet I ſhall take it down to the very foundation, and ſhew how weak that is, and how unable to bear what he would build upon it.</p>

               <hi>The Communion of Infants</hi> is the next cuſtom alledged by this Author; it was a very ancient, and almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal practice of the Church, to give the Euchariſt to little Children as ſoon as they were Baptized, thinking it to be as neceſſary to their Salvation as Baptiſm, and that they were as capable of the one as the other; and therefore the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which has condemned all thoſe who ſay the Euchariſt is neceſſary for Infants, has herein determined againſt the general ſence and practice of the Church, and put no leſs men than St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and

<hi>de Meaux,</hi> and 'tis one of the moſt artificial fetches that ever were; It is the onely argument which he has to prove that the Public Communion was not in both kinds; This remark upon the words of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and upon the Decree of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius,</hi> which is much of the like nature;
<hi>This fraudulent deſign,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of the</hi> Manichees,
<hi>could hardly be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe Catholics themſelves did not all of them Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate under both Species.</hi> But how knows he that?

If it had been ſo, and Catholics had not all of them Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under both Species, the <hi>Manichees</hi> would not have been diſcovered at all, for they would have done the ſame the Catholics did, and to all outward appearance been as good Catholics as they; they might have kept their Opinion and Hereſie to themſelves, and that it ſeems they intended to diſſemble and keep private; but as to their <hi>Practice</hi> it would have been but the ſame with others, and ſo they could not have been found out or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by <hi>that; But it was taken notice of at the last,</hi> ſays <hi>de Meaux, that theſe Heretics did it out of affectation, inſomuch that the holy Pope, St.</hi> Leo <hi>the Great, would that thoſe who were known as ſuch by this mark, ſhould be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church.</hi> How does it appear that their <hi>affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was taken notice of? or that they did it out of that? does Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſay any thing of this? but onely points at <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56128:44"/>their Practice without ſo much as intimating their <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> Was their <hi>affectation</hi> the
<hi>mark</hi> by which the Pope would have them known? As <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſlighly, but not honeſtly, makes him ſpeak, by putting thoſe words of his, as relating to his own that went before, whereas in <hi>Leo</hi> they relate not to the doing it outof <hi>affectation,</hi> for he ſpeaks not a word of that, but meerly to the <hi>not drinking the Bloud;</hi> This was the onely mark <hi>by which they were known as ſuch;</hi> by theſe
<hi>indicia,</hi> theſe <hi>marks</hi> and <hi>tokens</hi> of not drinking the Bloud, they were to be known, and diſcovered, and made <hi>manifest,</hi> according to the words of St. <hi>Leo,</hi> by their <hi>viſible Practice,</hi> not by their <hi>Opinion</hi> or their <hi>Affectation;</hi> and for this they were to be expelled the Society of Chriſtians, becauſe they refuſed to drink the Bloud of our Redemption, without regard to their private or particular reaſons, which St. <hi>Leo</hi> takes no notice of: Theſe cunning and diſſembling He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics to cover their diſſimulation and infidelity, and hide themſelves the better, which was it ſeems their main end and deſign, might take the Cup, but yet not drink of it nor taſt the leaſt drop of Wine; and <hi>for this cauſe there must have been time and a particular vigilance to diſcern theſe Heretics from amongst the Faithful,</hi> and not becauſe <hi>there was a general liberty to receive one or both Species;</hi> as <hi>de Meaux</hi> pretends, That <hi>liberty</hi> is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange thing which has no manner of evidence for it, <hi>which</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſays nothing of, but the quite contrary, namely, that the Body and Bloud were both received in the Communion; and <hi>which</hi> if it had been allowed, as it would have bred infinite confuſion in the Church, ſo the <hi>Manichees</hi> might have made uſe of it to their wicked purpoſe, of receiving onely in one kind.

<hi>Gelaſius,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was obliged to forbid expreſly to Communicate any other ways then under both Species: A ſigne that the thing was free before, and that they would not have thought of making this Ordinance, but to take from the</hi> Manicheans <hi>the means of deceiving.</hi> Was it then free till the time of Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> to receive either in one or both kinds? does any ſuch thing appear in the whole Chriſtian Church? or is there any inſtance of any one Public Communion without both kinds? is a Decree of a Church-Governour upon a <hi>particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> againſt
<hi>particular Heretics</hi> and ſuperſtitious Perſons new roſe up, and perſuant to a general Law of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and the Cuſtom of the whole Church? is that a ſign the thing was free before?

               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:56128:45"/>ſuch and ſuch Councils and Biſhops commanded them to come at ſuch times: Then it was free for the Prieſts who miniſter'd, to receive but in one kind, before this Decree of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> for 'tis to thoſe it is refer'd in <hi>Gratian,</hi> where the title of it is, <hi>The Priest ought not to receive the Body of Christ, without the Bloud</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The motive inducing this Pope to make this Decree was, becauſe he found that ſome did not receive the Blood as well as the Body; and the reaſon why they did not, was ſome either <hi>Manichean</hi> or other
<hi>Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> ſo that this Decree, I own, was occaſioned by them, and particularly relates to them, and ſhews that they herein differed from the Faithful, not onely in their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, but in the practice too; but to ſay that he forbad this practice onely in reſpect of ſuch a Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going along with it, and that he did not forbid the Practice
<hi>it ſelf,</hi> which was the effect of it, is ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe, that the Decree relates wholly to the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> and as to the
<hi>Superſtition</hi> it does not inform us what it was, or wherein it conſiſted; no doubt it muſt be ſome Superſtition or other, that hinders any from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Cup, the ſuperſtitious fear of ſpilling Chriſt's Blood, or the ſuperſtitious belief that one Species con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains both the Body and Bloud together, and ſo conveys<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56128:46"/>the whole vertue of both; which is truely Superſtition, as having no foundation in Scripture, or in the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, which gives the Sacrament its whole ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and and annexs it not to one but to both Species. And whatever the Superſtition be, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> declares it is Sacriledge to divide the Myſtery, or to take one Species without the other; the <hi>reaſon</hi> which he gives againſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one kind, is <hi>general</hi> and

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56128:46"/>from the Cup, unleſs the Cup of his ſacred Bloud had been offered to all in the Church? Theſe holy Popes did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as ſome imagine, appoint the uſe of both Species by a new Decree, but thoſe who neglected this ſolemn and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cuſtom of taking the Cup; one of theſe Popes would have them avoided and markt as thoſe, who were a-kin to the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichean <hi>Hereſie; the other would have them compelled to the accuſtomed perception of the entire Sacrament, or elſe to be wholly kept from all Communion, for there was need of no new Decree for the Catholics who did Religiouſly obſerve the received cuſtom of taking the Sacrament entirely, that is, in both kinds.</hi>

            <p>There needs much better Arguments to prove the Public Communion in the Church to have been ever in one kind, than ſuch improbable Gueſſes and forced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, whereby plain and full evidences are rackt and tortured to get that out of them, which is contrary to their whole teſtimony, ſenſe, and meaning.

               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:56128:47"/>Sunday; at thoſe times it ſeems, theſe two Churches have the Communion onely in one kind, as appears by their public Offices; if they have it ſo at thoſe times, at other times then, I ſuppoſe, they have it in both, or elſe how come thoſe <hi>particular times,</hi> and thoſe <hi>particular Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> to be <hi>ſingled out</hi> and remarked as diſtinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from all the reſt; then generally and for the moſt part the Public Communion is to be in both kinds, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tradition of both thoſe Churches; and then ſurely this Tradition which is thus <hi>conſecrated</hi> by both the Churches, is violated by the

Thoſe principles are like framing an Hypotheſis to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the reaſon of ſome ſtrange and extraordinary thing, which thing upon enquiry, proves falſe and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſo they are but like the <hi>Virtuoſo's</hi> ſolution of a Phoenominon, which, nothwithſtanding all his Philoſophic
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56128:52"/>fancy and fine <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> never was in Nature. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> muſt better prove to us the Practice of the Church for Communion in one kind, then he has yet done, before he eſtabliſhes ſuch Principles, by which ſuch a Practiſe may be made out; for whatever the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be, as long as the <hi>Practice</hi> is falſe, the Principles will not make it true. And ſince I have ſo largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Communion in both kinds, was the Practice of the Primitive and the whole Catholick Church for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twelve hundred years, and have diſproved all the inſtances of <hi>de Meaux</hi> to the contrary, ſo that no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of queſtion can be made of the truth of this matter of fact, unleſs where, as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays, <hi>Paſſion makes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicated perſons undertake and believe any thing</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 164.</note>: I have ſufficiently anſwered that part of <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Book, wherein the ſtrength of the whole lies, and that which is the ground and foundation of all the reſt being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the other falls of its ſelf; I might therefore ſpare my ſelf the trouble of Examining the Principles which
<hi>de Meaux</hi> layes down, as the Reaſons of the Churches practice; for if the Practice of the Church be againſt him, the <hi>reaſons</hi> of that Practice will be ſo too, and I may turn thoſe upon him as I have done the other: His third Principle, which is the moſt conſiderable, and <hi>which alone,</hi> he ſays, <hi>carries along with it, the deciſion of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 194.</note>, namely, That
<hi>the Law ought to be explained by conſtant and perpetual Practice,</hi> this is wholly for us, who are aſſured that we have the conſtant and perpetual Practice of the Church for ſo many Ages for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kinds, and therefore though the Law of Chriſt, which is ſo clear in it ſelf, that it needs nothing to explain it, be the main thing upon which the deciſion of this matter depends, yet the Tradition and Practice of the Church is a farther confirmation of the Law to us, and we ſhall be willing to joyn with <hi>de Meaux</hi> in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he can ſay for <hi>Tradition,</hi> provided it be ſo certain<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56128:52"/>and general and authentic, as we have proved it to be for Communion in both kinds, and provided that it do not deſtroy a plain Law of Chriſt, nor <hi>make void the Commandment of God,</hi> which we can never believe that an univerſal Tradition of the Catholic Church ever will do: What a vain and empty flouriſh ſome are uſed to make with a name of <hi>Tradition</hi> and the <hi>Church:</hi> I have ſhewn in this queſtion of the Communion in one kind, in the managing of which, I have, as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Attacked our enemies in their own Fortreſs</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 254.</note>, and taken this <hi>Goliah</hi> weapon out of their hands; and though the diſarming <hi>de Meaux</hi> of that, in which his whole ſtrength lies, is entirely to overcome him; yet ſince ſome of the reaſons he lays down to juſtifie his pretended Tradition, may without that, conſidered meerly by themſelves, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a ſeeming plauſibleneſs, if not real ſtrength in them to defend the Communion in one kind from thoſe <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent difficulties</hi> under which, as he owns, it labours, and which he would willingly take off from it: I ſhall in the laſt place conſider all thoſe principles and arguments from <hi>Reaſon</hi> which are laid down by him to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>His firſt principle is this: <hi>That in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments we are obliged to do not all that which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ hath done, but onely that which is eſſential to them.</hi> This we allow, and this principle, as he ſays, <hi>Is without contest:</hi> No Church, nor no Chriſtians, did ever think themſelves obliged to all thoſe
<hi>circumſtances</hi> with which Chriſt celebrated the bleſſed Euchariſt at its firſt Inſtitution; and as to Baptiſm, Chriſt himſelf did not perform, but onely command that Sacrament: I cannot think that Monſieur <hi>Jurieux</hi> ſhould propoſe this for a rule, as <hi>de Meaux</hi> charges him<note n="*" place="margin">P. 349.</note>, <hi>To do univerſally all that Jeſus Christ did, in ſuch ſort, that we ſhould regard all circumſtances he obſerved, as being of abſolute neceſſity.</hi> What to do it onely at night, and after ſupper, and in an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56128:53"/>upper room, and the like? This could never enter into any mans head of common underſtanding, much leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo learned a mans as Monſieur <hi>Jurieux.</hi> They who are ſo zealous for unleavened Bread, becauſe Chriſt <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably</hi> uſed it (for there are diſputes about it) at his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supper, though if he did it was onely by accident, yet do not think fit to enquire what was the <hi>particular ſort</hi> of Wine which he bleſſed and gave his Diſciples, nor think themſelves obliged to celebrate only in <hi>that,</hi> which yet they might do with as much reaſon; and though the putting Water into the Wine, which was very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and uſed very likely by the <hi>Jews</hi> and others in thoſe hot Countrys, is not remarked in the firſt Inſtitution; yet I know none that make any great ſcruple at it: As to the poſture of receiving, which has been the moſt controverted, yet the ſtiffeſt Contenders in that, have not thought it neceſſary to keep exactly to the ſame in which Chriſt gave and the Apoſtles received at firſt, which was diſcumbency; if theſe circumſtances indeed had been commanded, as a great many of the like nature were very preciſely to the <hi>Jews</hi> in their eating the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover, then they ought to have been obſerved in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Divine Law; but the Command of Chriſt, <hi>Do this;</hi> does not in the leaſt extend to theſe, but onely to the Sacramental Action of <hi>bleſſing Bread and eating it, bleſſing Wine and drinking it in remembrance of Chriſt:</hi> For that was the thing which Chriſt did, and which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to do; and the very ſame thing may be done with quite other circumſtances then thoſe with which he did it, with other words, for we know not what were the words with which Chriſt bleſt the Bread or the Wine; with other company, more or leſs then twelve men, in another poſture then that of lying, and in another place and time, and the like; he that does not plainly ſee thoſe to be circumſtances, and cannot eaſily diſtinguiſh them from the thing it ſelf which Chriſt did and commanded to be<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56128:53"/>done, muſt not know what it is to eat and to drink, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be with his own family, in ſuch a room of his own houſe, and at ſuch an hour of the day; 'tis certainly as eaſie to know what Chriſt inſtituted, and what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as to know this, and conſequently what belongs to the eſſence of the Sacrament without which it would not be ſuch a Sacrament as Chriſt celebrated and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as to know what it is to eat and to drink: and yet Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is pleaſed to make this the great difficulty,
<note place="margin">P. 239, 257, 349.</note> 
               <hi>To know what belongs to the eſſence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what does not, and to diſtinguiſh what is eſſential in it, from what is not.</hi> And by this means he endeavours to darken what is as clear as the light, and ſo to avoid the plaineſt Inſtitution and the cleareſt Command: <hi>The Inſtitution,</hi> ſays he, <hi>does not ſuffice, ſince the queſtion always returns to know what appertains to the eſſence of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, Jeſus Christ not having diſtinguiſht them. Jeſus Chriſt inſtituted this Sacrament in the evening, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the night in which he was to be delivered, it was at this time he would leave us his Body given for us:</hi> Does the time or the hour then belong to the Inſtitution? does this appertain to the eſſence of it? and is it not as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and evidently a <hi>circumſtance,</hi> as night or noon is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to eating and drinking? Does the command of Chriſt, <hi>Do this,</hi> belong to that or to the other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of doing it, when the ſame thing, the ſame Sacramental action may be done without them? is not this a plain rule to make a diſtinction between the <hi>act</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of performing it? <hi>Becauſe there were a great many things done by Jeſus Christ in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which we do not believe our ſelves obliged to do:</hi> ſuch as being in an upper Room, lying upon a Bed, and the like, which are not properly things done by Chriſt, ſo much as circumſtances of doing it; for the thing done, was taking Bread and Wine, and bleſſing and diſtributing them; does therefore Chriſt's command <hi>Do this,</hi> belong<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56128:54"/>no more to eating and drinking, than it does to thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, or rather circumſtances with which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thoſe? is drinking as much a circumſtance as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it after ſupper, if it be, earing may be ſo too? Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is aſhamed to ſay this, but yet 'tis what he aims at; for elſe the Cup will neceſſarily appear to belong to the Sacrament as an eſſential, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an indiſpenſible part of it; and this may be plainly known to be ſo from the words of Chriſt and from Scripture, without the help of Tradition; though that alſo, as I have ſhewn, does fully agree with thoſe, but they are ſo plain as not to need it in this caſe: Eating and drinking are ſo plainly the eſſential part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo clearly diſtinguiſht from the other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in Scripture, that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> always ſpeaks of thoſe without any regard to the other:
<hi>The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ? the Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note>? <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death till he come</hi>

               </gap> other of Communion in one kind, for his aim in all this is to make immerſion as eſſential to Baptiſm, as eating and drinking to the Lord's Supper? and if Scripture and Tradition be both ſo fully for it, I know not what can be againſt it; but <hi>de Meaux</hi> knows <hi>ſome Gentlemen who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer things as best pleaſes them;</hi>

            <p>The ſecond principle of <hi>de Meaux</hi> is, <hi>That to diſtinguiſh what appertains or does not appertain to the ſubſtance of a Sacrament; we must regard the eſſential effect of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> But muſt we regard nothing elſe? muſt we not regard the outward part as well as the inward? and does not that appertain to the ſubſtance of a Sacrament
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56128:55"/>as well as the other? I confeſs the word ſubſtance which <hi>de Meaux</hi> uſes, is equivocal and ambiguous, for it may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie either the outward part of it as 'tis a ſacred ſign or ſymbol, and ſo the matter and form does appertain to the ſubſtance oreſſence of it, or it may ſignifie the inward grace and vertue, which is alſo of the ſubſtance of the Sacrament as 'tis the thing ſignified, and it is not onely one but both of theſe that do appertain to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, or to ſpeak more clearly and plainly, that make it a Sacrament: If <hi>de Meaux</hi> underſtands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe by the ſubſtance of the Sacrament but the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential effect of it, then his words are confuſed and run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and he had as good have put it thus:
<hi>That to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh what appertains or does not appertain to the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al effect of the Sacrament, we must regard the eſſential effect of the Sacrament:</hi> Which though it had not been ſenſe, yet he had better told us his meaning by it; but ſurely there is ſomething elſe that does plainly belong to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, beſides the eſſential effect; 'tis ſtrange that <hi>de Meaux, the Treaſury of Wiſdom, the Fountain of Eloquence, the Oracle of his Age,</hi> as he is ſtiled by the Tranſlator, but who like the Oracles of old, too often
<hi>doubles</hi> and <hi>equivocates,</hi> that ſo great a man ſhould not either underſtand or conſider the plain nature of a Sacrament, ſo as to account the external and viſible part to belong to the eſſence or ſubſtance of it, as well as the internal or the eſſential effect: Does not every <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> tell us that the Sacrament is made up of theſe two parts, of the <hi>Res Terrena</hi> and <hi>Caeleſtis,</hi> as

               <hi>It is not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, whereby ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm ſaveth us, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God.</hi> Yet ſtill we are to obſerve the outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and may know by another way, namely, from the Inſtitution, that that does appertain to the ſubſtance of it; elſe with the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> we may leave off all Sacraments, and all the poſitive and outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Chriſtianity, and onely regard the <hi>eſſential effect</hi> and inviſible grace of them, which they alſo pretend to have without the viſible ſign: As <hi>waſhing with water</hi> does appertain to the ſubſtance of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> ſo does
<hi>eating Bread and drinking Wine</hi> appertain to the ſubſtance of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; and we muſt regard thoſe which are the true matter of this Sacrament as well as the <hi>eſſential effect</hi> of it; elſe how were the <hi>Aquarii</hi> that uſed Water, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that uſed Milk, reproved ſo ſeverely by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> if the keeping to the outward Elements which Chriſt has inſtituted and appointed, be not as well to be regarded as the inward and eſſential effect? and if theſe do not appertain to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, and could not be eaſily known and diſtinguiſht from the other circumſtances of the Sacrament, by other means than by regard to the eſſential effect, which they might hope to partake of without them: <hi>DeMeaux</hi> is ſo wholly taken up with the <hi>eſſential Effect,</hi> and <hi>entire Fruit,</hi> and the <hi>inſeparable Grace</hi> of the Sacrament, with which words he hopes to blind and amuſe his Reader, and therefore he drops them almoſt in half the Pages of his Book, that he takes not due care, nor is much concerned about the outward and viſible part of the Sacrament, which he knows is ſo groſly violated, and ſhamefully mangled, and mutilated in his Church, and yet this is ſo conſiderable,<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56128:56"/>that 'tis not a true Sacrament without it; and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> plainly calls the dividing of the outward part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the dividing of the Myſtery; and to be plain with him, and to give the killing blow to his cauſe, and to all the artifical ſlights with which he fences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it, and as he ſpeaks, <hi>For once to ſtop the mouth of theſe Cavillers,</hi> I ſhall lay down this principle,
<hi>that the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial effect or inward ſubſtance of the Sacrament is not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be received or partaken, without receiving and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the external part or the outward ſubſtance of it, which is inſtituted and appointed by Christ:</hi> And by this plain principle which I have made uſe of before, and ſhall further ſtrengthen and confirm, all that he ſays about receiving the Grace, and Vertue, and eſſential Effect of the Sacrament by one kind, will be quite taken off and deſtroyed; but becauſe this is the great Plea, and the fundamental reaſoning which he every-where uſes in his Book, I ſhall therefore fully conſider it under theſe two Queſtions:
<list>

This <hi>de Meaux</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-where aſſerts, and 'tis the foundation he all along goes upon; but is it not ſtrange preſumption when God has been pleaſed to appoint ſuch a Religious Rite and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Action to be performed in ſuch a manner, with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56128:57"/>a promiſe of ſuch graces and benefits to thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it aright, to think he will grant the ſame benefits to thoſe who perform it otherwiſe than he has appointed, and to venture to make a change and alteration from what he poſitively ordered, and yet think to partake of the ſame benefits another way, without any ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, and without any Sacraments at all, for they are wholly in his own free diſpoſal; and he is not tied to any outward means, nor to ſuch particular means as the Sacraments are; but ſince he has thought fit to make them the ordinary means of conveying thoſe benefits to us, we cannot ordinarily hope for the one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; thus we cannot expect the vertue and benefit of Baptiſm without the outward ceremony of waſhing, and without obſerving that in ſuch a way as Chriſt has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>i. e.</hi> waſhing with Water in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; neither can we receive the inward grace and vertue of the Euchariſt without taking <hi>that</hi> Sacrament as Chriſt hath appointed and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, for all Sacraments would looſe their worth and value, their eſteem and reverence, and would not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obſerved according to the Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if without the obſervance of <hi>that</hi> we had any juſt grounds to hope for the vertue and benefits of them; there is therefore all the reaſon in the World to fear that God to preſerve the integrity of his own Inſtitution, and the force and authority of his own Laws, will deny the inward Grace and Vertue of the Sacrament to thoſe who wilfully violate and tranſgreſs the outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it in ſuch a way as he has appointed: Has not Chriſt annexed the inward Grace and Vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the outward Sign? If he have, and we do not receive the outward Sign as he has appointed, how can we then hope to receive the inward Grace? What is it that makes ſuch an outward ſign or ceremony as a Sacrament, be a means of conveying ſuch ſpiritual Grace<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56128:57"/>and Vertue, and exibiting ſuch inward benefits to our minds? It is not any phyſical power, or natural vertue which they have in themſelves; it is not the waſhing with a little Water can cleanſe the Soul, or the eating a little Bread and drinking a little Wine, can nouriſh and ſtrengthen it, but it is the Divine Power of Chriſt, who by his Inſtitution has given ſuch a ſpiritual and inward vertue to ſuch outward ſigns and viſible actions, and made theſe the means and inſtruments of conveying and exhibiting ſuch grace and vertue and real benefits to us; all the power and efficacy they have to do this is owing purely to the Divine Inſtitution, and wholly depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that; if therefore we do not obſerve the Inſtitution, how can we expect the benefit that comes wholly from that, and if Chriſt by the Inſtitution has annexed the grace, and vertue, and benefit of the Sacrament to both kinds, which he has plainly done by inſtituting of both; how can we then hope to receive it by one contrary to the Inſtitution? and how can we be aſſured that we looſe nothing, and are deprived of nothing by taking one onely, and that this is as good and ſufficient as taking of both? There is nothing appears from the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him that inſtituted both, upon which the whole vertue of them does entirely depend, from whence we can gather any ſuch thing, it rather appears from thence that both are neceſſary, becauſe bothare inſtituted; <hi>de Meaux</hi> therefore does not fetch it from thence, but from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it ſelf, from the <hi>inſeperableneſs</hi> of that grace which is given in the Sacrament, and from the
<hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi> in the thing to have it otherwiſe:
<hi>Christ,</hi> ſays he, <hi>cannot ſeperate the vertue of the Sacrament, nor effect that any other grace ſhould accompany his Blood ſhed, than that ſame in the ground and ſubſtance which accompanies his Body immolated</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 182.</note>.

               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 182.</note>: If the effect of theſe be not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till they are both received, and there be no applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the effect, as we cannot be aſſured there is without the receiving of both: <hi>But did Christ then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſuſpend the effect which his Body was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, until ſuch time as the Apoſtles had received the Bloud,</hi> in the firſt inſtitution of this Sacrament, and in the internal between their taking the Bread and the Cup? I anſwer, they did not receive the grace of the Sacrament till they had received the whole Sacrament, becauſe the grace and effect was annexed to the whole and not to any part of it; and therefore the effect may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſuſpended till the whole is taken, but even utterly loſt without receiving the whole. It is a little too nice and curious to enquire what are the preciſe moments in which we receive this grace of the Sacrament, or any other ordinance as well as what is the particular manner in which we do receive it, as whether all at once or by part, or whether the effect be given in ſuch a minute, or ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56128:58"/>till the next? In return to <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s queſtion, I might as well ask him whether the effect of the Body is given when 'tis juſt put into the mouth? or when the ſpecies is chewed there? or when it is ſwallowed down and comes into the ſtomack? or whether it be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till all this is done? So in Baptiſm which he will needs have to be commanded by Chriſt, and anciently practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by immerſion; Was the grace of it given when part of the body was dipt, or the whole immerged? and then, whether when the body was under water, or when it was raiſed out of it? and when this was performed by Trine Immerſion, as 'tis commanded in the <hi>Apoſtolic Canons</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Canon.</hi> 50.</note>, was the effect of it ſuſpended till the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion was over? ſo in the <hi>Jews</hi> eating of their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices whereby they were made partakers of the Altar, and had the vertue of thoſe applied to them, as we by feeding on the Chriſtian Sacrifice do partake of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that, Was this done by the firſt bit they ate of them? or was the half the vertue applied when they had ate half? or was the whole ſuſpended till the whole was eaten? By theſe queſtions I hope <hi>de Meaux</hi> may ſee the vain ſubtilty and folly of his own, which he thinks is ſo much to the purpoſe, and does the buſineſs of proving the effect of the Sacrament to be given by one Species either before or without the other; when the effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, beſides other things, upon the whole action, and the whole performance, and the receiving of both of them. When there is a conveyance of a thing by ſome viſible ceremony which conſiſts of ſeveral parts and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions; as ſuppoſe the conveying an Eſtate by Deed, there is to be the ſetting of a Hand, and the putting of a Seal, and the delivery of it, and ſomething given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as Livery and Seizin, and the like; all thoſe things which the Law requires to be done as a form of paſſing and transferring of a right from one and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it by another; theſe are all to be done before the

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To make the whole Grace, and Vertue, and entire Fruit of the Sacrament to be given by one Species, is to render the other wholly uſeleſs and ſuperfluous as to the conveying any real vertue or benefit to him that receives it.

                  <hi>De Euch.</hi> l. 4. c. 23.</note>: But if it be ſo to the Prieſts, why may it not likewiſe to the people? and if the Prieſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any benefit by the Cup, which they would not have without it, why may not the people alſo? For they have not yet declared, that I know of, that the Prieſt is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more grace by the Sacrament than the people: What a meer empty Cup muſt the Prieſt then receive, void of all grace and vertue, after he has taken the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread which has before given him the whole and entire fruit and grace of the Sacrament, to which the Cup can add nothing at all? It muſt be then as utterly fruitleſs to him, as the Wine of <hi>ablution</hi> is to the Laiety, and if it be ſo inconſiderable, they need not, methinks, be ſo afraid of the Laymens ſpilling it or dipping their Beards and Whiskers in it; but <hi>it is ſtill the very natural and true Blood of Christ;</hi> if it be ſo, 'tis ſtrange that it ſhould have no true and eſſential vertue belonging to it, ſurely Chriſt's Bloud is never without that, nor ought any to have ſo mean and low an opinion of it.</p>
            <p>Why did Chriſt give the Cup to the Apoſtles, as part of the Sacrament, if they had received the whole grace and vertue of the Sacrament before? and if <hi>ſo ſoon as they had received his Body, at the ſame inſtant they received the whole grace that accompanied that,</hi> and his Blood too? Chriſt if he did not <hi>ſuſpend</hi> the effect of the Blood till it was taken, muſt have <hi>prevented</hi> it, and given it before it was. Chriſt no doubt might have given the whole grace and effect of the Sacrament by one Species, if he had pleaſed; but if he had done that, he would not have given the other, nor ſhould we have had two Species In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by him, if he had reſtrained the effect of thoſe two to one onely: When Chriſt has appointed two and<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56128:61"/>gave two himſelf, for men to come and argue that one alone may give the whole good of both, becauſe <hi>the Grace of both is the ſame, and inſeparable from either, and becauſe Christ did not ſuſpend the effect of one till he gave the other, and that 'tis impoſſible he ſhould ſeparate the effect of his Bloud from that of his Body;</hi> this is to argue at all adventures againſt what is known, from what is ſecret and uncertain, againſt the plain will of Chriſt from his power, and againſt what he has done from what he might do, and is to ſet up a precarious and ungrounded Hypotheſis of our own, from the nature of the thing, when the thing itſelf is purely arbitrary and poſitive, and depends wholly upon Chriſt's will and pleaſure. If Chriſt himſelf has appointed two Species in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to convey the whole and entire vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to worthy receivers, as he ſeems plainly to have done by inſtituting both, and giving both to his Apoſtles, and commanding both; how groundleſs and arrogant is it in any to ſay, That one is ſufficient to give this, and that both are not neceſſary to this end; without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing further of Chriſt's will about it; and when they believe as <hi>de Meaux</hi> does,
<note n="†" place="margin">P. 130.</note> 
               <hi>That Jeſus Christ has equally inſtituted both parts;</hi> Yet notwithſtanding to make one unneceſſary to the giving any real vertue and benefit, and to dare to affirm as <hi>de Meaux</hi> does,

179.</note>; and for this reaſon, <hi>both Species are always conſecrated, that ſo they may be offered to God, and a more lively repreſentation may be made of Christ's death.</hi> But this is no anſwer to the queſtion, for I do not ask why they are neceſſary as the Euchariſt is a
<hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which it is not in a proper<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56128:61"/>ſence, though it be not my buſineſs to ſhew that here, but as it is a
<hi>Sacrament;</hi> Why did Chriſt inſtitute both Species in the Euchariſt, as it is a <hi>Sacrament?</hi> and why did he give both Species to his Apoſtles? He did not give theſe to them as a Sacrifice, for as ſuch, if it were ſo, it was to be onely offered up to God; but he gave both the Species to his Diſciples; and why did he do this, if the whole grace and vertue of the Sacrament was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by one? and why does the Prieſt receive both as well as offer both to God? He does not receive them as a Sacrifice, but as a Sacrament: And why is the Sumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both neceſſary to him, as the Euchariſt is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays it is, <hi>upon that very account</hi>

All theſe queſtions will return upon <hi>de Meaux</hi> though the Euchariſt were a Sacrifice; and as to that I ſhall onely ask him this queſtion, Whether Chriſt did as truly and properly offer up his Body and Blood as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God when he inſtituted this Sacrament, as he did upon the Croſs? If he did, and therefore two Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were neceſſary, (though if his Body and Blood be both together in one, that might be ſufficient) why need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he then to have afterwards offered up himſelf upon the Croſs, when he had as truly offered up his Body and Blood before in the Euchariſt?</p>
            <p>If two Species are neceſſary to make a full repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's death, and to preſerve a perfect image of his Sacrifice upon the Croſs, and by the myſtical ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, to repreſent how they were really ſeparated at his death; why are they not then neceſſary as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays, <hi>They are not to the ground of the Myſtery:</hi> Is not the Euchariſt as it is a Sacrament, deſigned to do all this, and to be ſuch a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Christ,</hi> and <hi>a ſhewing forth the Lord's death<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56128:62"/>till he come;</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks? And do not they in great meaſure deſtroy this, by giving the Sacrament in one kind, without this myſtical ſeparation of Chriſt's Body and Blood; and without preſerving ſuch a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Repreſentation of it as Chriſt has appointed? But ſays <hi>de Meaux, The ultimate exactneſs of repreſentation is not requiſite</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 175.</note>. This I confeſs, for then the eating the Fleſh and drinking the Bloud of a man, as ſome <hi>Heretics</hi> did of an Infant, might more exactly repreſent than Bread and Wine; but ſuch a repreſentation as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has appointed and commanded, this is requiſite: and when he can prove that Chriſt has commanded Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Baptiſm to repreſent the cleanſing of the Soul, as he has done taking Bread broken and Wine poured out in the Euchariſt, to repreſent his Death, I will own that to be requiſite in anſwer to his §. 11. There ought to be alſo an expreſſion of the grace of the Sacrament, which is not found in one Species alone, for that is not a full expreſſion of our perfect nouriſhment both by meat and drink; and if the Sacraments onely exhibit what they repreſent, which is an Axiom of the School-men; then as one kind repreſents our ſpiritual nouriſhment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, ſo it exhibits it imperfectly; but however, if the whole grace and vertue of the Sacrament be given by one Species, the other muſt be wholly ſuperfluous and unneceſſary as to the inward effect, and ſo at moſt it muſt be but a meer ſignificant ſign, void of all grace, as <hi>de Meaux</hi> indeed makes it, though the name of a ſign, as applied to the Sacrament, is ſo hard to go down with them at other times, when he ſays of the ſpecies of Wine, <hi>That the whole fruit of the Sacrament is given without it, and that this can adde nothing thereunto, but onely a more full expreſſion of the ſame Myſtery</hi>

            <p n="2">II. The ſecond queſtion I propoſed to conſider, was, Whether one Species containing both Chriſt's Body and Blood by the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56128:62"/>the perſon of Chriſt whole and entire by the Doctrine of Concomitancy, do not contain and give whole Chriſt, and ſo the whole ſubſtance and thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified of the Sacrament?

               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 306. §. 9.</note>; <hi>ſo that we have in his Fleſh his Blood, and in his Blood his Fleſh, and in either of the two his Perſon whole and entire, and in both the one and the other his bleſſed Soul with his Divinity, whole and entire, ſo that there is in either of the Species the whole ſubſtance of the Sacrament, and together with that ſubſtance the whole eſſential vertue of the Eucharist</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 327.</note>, according to theſe Principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. I am not here to diſpute againſt thoſe, nor to ſhew the falſeneſs and unreaſonableneſs of that which is the ground of them, and which if it be falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all the reſt, I mean <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> whereby they ſuppoſe the Bread to be turn'd into the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body of Chriſt, with Fleſh, Bones, Nerves, and all other parts belonging to it, and the Wine to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very natural ſubſtance of his Bloud; and ſince this Fleſh is not a dead Fleſh, it muſt have the Blood joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and even the very Soul and Divinity of Chriſt, which is always Hypoſtatically united to it, and ſo does neceſſarily accompany it; and the Body with Chriſt's Soul and Divinity, muſt thus likewiſe ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his Blood: To which prodigious Doctrine of theirs as it relates to the Communion in one kind, I have theſe things to ſay:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It does ſo confound the two Species, and make them to be one and the ſame thing, that it renders the diſtinct conſecration of them to be not onely imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent but ſenceleſs; For to what purpoſe, or with what ſenſe can the words of Conſecration be ſaid over the Bread,
<hi>This is my Body?</hi> and thoſe again over the Wine, <hi>This is my Blood:</hi> If upon the ſaying of them by the Prieſt the Bread does immediately become both the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56128:63"/>and Blood of Chriſt, and the Wine both his Blood and his Body too; this is to make the Bread become the ſame thing with the Wine, and the Wine the ſame thing with the Bread, and to make onely the ſame thing twice over, and to do that again with one form of words which was done before with another; for upon repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> Chriſt's Body and Blood are both of them immediately and truly preſent; and when they are ſo, what need is there of the other form, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> to make the ſame thing preſent again, which was truly preſent before? It matters not at all in this caſe, whether they be preſent by vertue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, or by vertue of Concomitancy, for if they be truly preſent once, what need they be preſent again, if they become the ſame thing after the firſt form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration which they do after the ſecond? why do they become the ſame thing twice? or what need is there of another form of words to make the Wine become that which the Bread was before? they hold it indeed to be Sacriledge not to conſecrate both the Species, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee according to this principle of theirs, why the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating of one Species ſhould not be ſufficient, when upon the conſecration of that, it immediately becomes both Chriſt's Body and Blood; and what reaſon is there for making the ſame Body and Blood over again by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother conſecration? They might if they pleaſed ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Bread alone, <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum, &amp; hoc est ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis meus; This is my Body, and this is my Bloud:</hi> for they believe it is ſo upon the ſaying thoſe words, <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum; This is my Body.</hi> And if it be ſo as ſoon as the words are pronounced, they may as truly affirm it to be both as one: What does it ſignifie to ſay, they are both preſent by Concomitancy? does not Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy always go along with the Conſecration? is there any ſpace between the Conſecration and the Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy? is not the one as quick and ſudden as the other?
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56128:63"/>and can it be ſaid over the Species of Bread, <hi>This is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> before it can be as truly ſaid, <hi>This is my Blood?</hi> why therefore may not they be both ſaid together? Nay, it may be as truly ſaid by vertue of this Doctrine not only, This is my Body and Blood, but this is my Soul and my Divinity; for though they will not ſay it is <hi>made</hi> all thoſe, yet it <hi>becomes</hi> all thoſe, and truly <hi>is</hi> all thoſe by this Concomitancy upon the Conſecration, and it may be ſaid to
<hi>be</hi> all thoſe as ſoon as it is conſecrated, and at the ſame time that thoſe words are ſpoke.</p>
            <p>There being a diſtinct Conſecration of Chriſt's Body and Bloud in the Sacrament, if Chriſt's Body and Bloud be really preſent there by vertue of the words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, yet they ought to be as diſtinctly preſent as they are diſtinctly conſecrated, that is, the Body preſent in the ſpecies of Bread, and the Blood in the ſpecies of Wine, for elſe they are not preſent according to the Conſecration; ſo that this Concomitancy by which they are preſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, does quite ſpoile the Conſecration by which they are preſent aſunder, and ſo confounds the two Species as to make them become both the ſame thing after they are conſecrated, and renders the conſecration of one of them to be without either uſe or ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It makes the diſtinct Sumption of both the Species to be vain and unneceſſary to any perſons, to the Prieſts or to any others to whom the Pope has ſometimes gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and even to the Apoſtles and all the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who received both; for if the one contains the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame thing with the other, and gives the very ſame thing, what need is there of having or of taking both, that is, of taking the very ſame thing twice over at the ſame time? If one Species contain Jeſus Chriſt whole and entire, his Body, Bloud, Soul, and Divinity, and all theſe are given by one Species, what can be deſired more as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays. Then Jeſus Chriſt himſelf? and what then can the other Species give but the ſame thing? is<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56128:64"/>Jeſus Chriſt with whole Humanity and Divinity to be thus taken over and over, and to be taken twice at the ſame time? if he be, why not ſeveral times more, and if he were ſo, this might be done by taking ſeveral times the ſame Species, ſince one Species contains the ſame as both, even the whole ſubſtance, and the whole eſſential effect of the Sacrament, and the very perſon of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. This does ſo alter the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by which we have a continual nouriſhment conveyed to our Souls, and receive the Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt by freſh and daily recruits, and in ſeveral meaſures and degrees every time we Communicate, that it makes it not onely to no purpoſe for any perſon to take more than one Species at once, but to take the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament more than once all his whole life, for what need he deſire more, who has received <hi>together with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Jeſus Chriſt, his Divinity alſo whole and entire</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 314.</note>, and if he has received that once, there is no reaſon for receiving it again, for this as it renders the Grace and Subſtance of the Sacrament <hi>Indiviſible,</hi> as <hi>de Meaux</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pleades, ſo it renders it <hi>Infinite,</hi> to which nothing can be ever added by receiving it never ſo often; and if we thus make this Sacrament to give the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and ſo the whole and entire Perſon of Chriſt, and his whole Humanity and his whole Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, inſtead of giving the ſpiritual <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of Chriſt's Body and Bloud, we then make every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant to receive all that by one ſingle Communion which he can ever receive by never ſo many thouſands, and we make all perſons to receive this alike, however different the preparations and diſpoſitions of their minds are, and even the moſt wicked and vile wretches muſt receive, not onely Chriſt's Body and Blood, but even his Soul, and his Divinity, and his whole and entire Perſon; for though the ſpiritual graces and vertues may be given in different meaſures and degrees, and in different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56128:64"/>according to the capacity of the receiver, yet the Humanity and Divinity of Chriſt, which is whole and entire in each Species, never can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If Chriſt's Body and Bloud were thus always joyned together in the Sacrament, and were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in one Species, yet this would not be a true <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental</hi> reception of them, for to make
<hi>that,</hi> they ought to be taken as ſeparate and divided from one another, his Body from his Blood, and his Bloud from his Body, and not as conjoyned or mixt together; this was the way and manner which Chriſt himſelf appointed, and this is the onely way by which we can be ſaid to eat his Body and to drink his Blood: and as they own they ought to be thus conſecrated, ſo they ought alſo to be thus received, for I cannot underſtand why they might not be as well conſecrated together as received together, and why it would not be as true a Sacrament with ſuch a
<hi>Conſecration</hi> as with ſuch a <hi>Sumption;</hi> nay, I think the Conſecration this way would have more ſenſe in it than the Sumption, for it is nothing ſo odd and ſtrange to ſuppoſe the Bread to be turned into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, as to ſuppoſe that by eating <hi>that</hi> we both eat the Body and drink the Blood of Chriſt; to make eating and drinking the ſame thing, or to ſay we <hi>drink</hi> by <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>eat</hi> by <hi>drinking,</hi> are very unaccountable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible expreſſions, ſo that Concomitancy does whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confound thoſe two Sacramental Phraſes and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Actions: <hi>But is it not enough,</hi> ſays <hi>de Meaux</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">P.
323.</note>, <hi>for a Chriſtian to receive Jeſus Christ? is it not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where Jeſus Christ is pleaſed to be in perſon?</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt is not received in the Sacrament in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner but by receiving his Body and Bloud, nor is it his Perſon he bids us receive, but his Body and Bloud, and the way by which we are to receive them is by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one and drinking the other, and we cannot be properly ſaid to do that, or to receive Chriſt or his<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56128:65"/>Body and Blood Sacramentally, but this way: Though the Body and Blood of Chriſt, therefore ſhould be both in one Species and both received by one Species, yet this would not be the eating the Body and the drinking the Blood, for as one of their own Popes,
<hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, ſays, and <hi>Durandus</hi> from him,
<hi>Neither is the Blood drunk under the Species of Bread, nor the Body eaten under the Species of Wine, for as the Blood is not eaten nor the Body drank, ſo neither is drunk under the Species of Bread nor eat under the Species of Wine</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nec ſanguis ſub ſpecie panis nec Corpus ſub ſpecie vini bibitur aut comeditur, quia ſicut nec ſanguis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditur nec Corpus bibitur ita neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum ſub ſpecies panis bibitur aut ſub ſpecie vini comeditur.</hi> Durand. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. <hi>l.</hi> 4.
<hi>c.</hi> 42.</note>. And therefore though they ſhould be both received according to them by one Species, yet they would not be both eat and drank, that is received Sacramentally; eating and drinking are diſtinct things, and both belong to the Sacrament; and though eating and drinking ſpiritually be as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays, The ſame thing<note n="†" place="margin">P.
184.</note>, and <hi>both the one and the other is to believe:</hi> Yet eating and drinking Sacramentally are not, but are to be two diſtinct outward actions that are to go along in the Sacrament with our inward Faith.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine of Concomitancy and of receiving the Body and Blood of Chriſt together in that groſs manner which is believed in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, does quite ſpoile the Sacramental reception of Chriſt's Body and Bloud, for according to <hi>that,</hi> they can never be received <hi>ſeparate</hi> and <hi>apart,</hi> no not by the two Species, but they muſt be always received <hi>together</hi> in either of them; ſo that though by the Inſtitution the Species of Bread ſeems par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to contain, or rather give the Body, and the Species of Wine the Bloud, and as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſays<note n="‖" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note>,
<hi>The bread which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? and the cup which we bleſs, is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the blood of Christ?</hi> Yet hereby <hi>either</hi> of them is made the Communion of both, and it is made impoſſible to receive them aſunder, as Chriſt inſtituted and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56128:65"/>and as is plainly implied by eating and drinking, and ſeems to be the very nature of a Sacramental reception: But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This Concomitancy makes us to receive Chriſt's Body and Bloud not as ſacrificed and ſhed for us upon the Croſs, but as they are now living and both joyned together in Heaven, whereas Chriſt's Body and Bloud is given in the Sacrament, not as in the <hi>ſtate of life</hi> and glory, but as under the <hi>ſtate of death,</hi> for ſo he tells us, <hi>This is my body which is given for you,</hi> that is, to God as a Sacrifice and Oblation, and, <hi>This is my blood which is ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> So that we are to take Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament as it was crucified for us and offered up upon the Croſs, and his Bloud as it was ſhed and poured out, not as joyned with his Body, but as ſeparated from it: the Vertue of Chriſt's Body and Bloud cometh from his Death and from its being a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which was ſlain, and whoſe Blood was poured out for to make expiation for our Sins, and as ſuch we are to take Chriſt's Body and Bloud, that is, the vertue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of them in the Sacrament, for as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays,
<note n="*" place="margin">P. 311.</note> 
               <hi>This Body and this Blood with which he nouriſheth and quickneth us, would not have the vertue if they had not been once actually ſeparated, and if this ſeparation had not cauſed the violent Death of our Saviour, by which he became our Victim.</hi> So neither will it have that vertue in the Sacrament if the Body be not taken as broken and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, and the Bloud as ſhed or poured out, and both as ſeparated from one another: <hi>De Meaux</hi> owns, <hi>We ought to have our living Victim under an image of Death, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould not be enlivened</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 312.</note>. I do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning of a <hi>living Victim,</hi> for though Chriſt who was our Victim is alive, yet he was a Victim onely as he died; ſo that a living Victim is perhaps as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper a phraſe as a dead Animal. If we are to receive Chriſt then in the Sacrament as a Victim or Sacrifice,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56128:66"/>we are to receive him not as living but as dead; I would not have <hi>de Meaux</hi> or any elſe miſtake me, as if I aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we received a dead Body, <hi>a dead fleſh, a carcaſe</hi> as he calls it
<note n="‖" place="margin">P. 309.</note> in the Sacrament, for he knows we do not believe that we receive any real fleſh, or any proper natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body at all, but onely the myſtical or ſacramental Body of Chriſt, or to ſpeak plainer, the true and real Vertue of Chriſt's Body and Bloud offered for us, and <hi>we are</hi> not onely <hi>to have this under an image of death,</hi> that is, to have the two Species ſet before us to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but we are to receive it under this image, and to eat the Body as broken, and the Bloud as poured out, and ſo to partake of Chriſt's death in the very partaking of the Sacrament; <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſpeaks very well, when he ſays,
<note n="*" place="margin">P. 312.</note> 
               <hi>The Vertue of Christ's Body and his Blood coming from his Death, he would conſerve the image of his Death when he gave us them in his holy Supper, and by ſo lively a repreſentation keep us always in mind to the cauſe of our Salvation, that is to ſay, the Sacrifice of the Croſs.</hi> But how is this image of his Death conſerved in his holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if Chriſt be there given not as dead but living, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy does rather mind us of Chriſt's Reſurrection when his Body was made alive again and reunited to his Soul and to his Divinity, than of his death when it was divided and ſeparated from them; and it makes us not to partake of Chriſt's Body as crucified upon the Croſs, but as glorified in Heaven; as it is ſo indeed Chriſt's body cannot be divided from his bloud, and his whole humanity, ſoul, and body are always united with his Divinity, but we do not take it as ſuch in the Sacrament, but as his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſacrificed, and flain, and wounded, and his bloud as ſhed and ſeparated from it.</p>
            <p>They who can think of a crucified Saviour, may think of receiving him thus in the Sacrament <hi>without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; de Meaux</hi> owns, That this myſtical ſeparation of Chriſt's body and bloud ought to be in the Euchariſt as<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56128:66"/>it is a Sacrifice<note n="†" place="margin">P. 180, 181.</note>: And why not then as it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? is there any more horror to have Chriſt's body thus conſecrated, then thus eaten and received? <hi>The words of conſecration,</hi> he ſays, <hi>do renew myſtically, as by a ſpiritual Sword, together with all the wounds he received in his body, the total effuſion of his blood</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib.</hi>
               </note>. Why may we not then receive Chriſt's body as thus wounded, and his bloud as thus poured out, in this myſtical Table? and why muſt Concomitancy joyn thoſe together which Conſecration has thus ſeparated and divided? Chriſt's body and bloud we ſay ought to be thus myſtically ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the Sacramental reception of them, and ſo ought to be taken ſeparately and diſtinctly; they own they ought to be thus myſtically ſeparated in the conſecration, though how that conſiſts with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy is hard to underſtand, but whatever they have to ſay againſt the ſeparating them in the <hi>Reception,</hi> may be as well ſaid againſt their ſeparating them in the <hi>Conſecration;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 310.</note> 
               <hi>Is Christ then divided? is his body then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled of bloud? and blood actually ſeparated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? ought Christ to die often, and often to ſhed his blood? A thing unworthy the glorious ſtate of his Reſurrection, where he ought to conſerve eternally humane nature as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire as he had at first aſſumed it.</hi> Why do they then make this ſeparation of his body and bloud when they conſecrate it? if that be onely myſtical and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſo is it in our reception much better, for we do not pretend to receive Chriſt's natural body and bloud, as they do to conſecrate them, but onely his myſtical body and bloud, which is always <hi>to conſerve this figure of Death, and the character of a Victim,</hi> not onely when it is conſecrated, but when it is eaten and drunk, which it cannot otherwiſe be. 'Tis this errour of receiving Chriſt's natural body in the Sacrament which has led men into all thoſe dark Mazes and Labyrinths wherein they have bewildred and entangled themſelves in this<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56128:67"/>matter, and ſo by applying all the properties of Chriſt's natural body to his myſtical body in the Sacrament, they have run themſelves into endleſs difficulties, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the very notion as well as the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The third Principle of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is this:
<hi>That the Law ought to be explained by conſtant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual practice.</hi> But cannot then a Law of God be ſo plain and clear as to be very well known and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all thoſe to whom it is given, without being thus explained? Surely ſo wiſe a Law-Giver as our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, would not give a Law to all Chriſtians that was not eaſie to be underſtood by them; it cannot be ſaid without great reflection upon his infinite Wiſdom, that his Laws are ſo obſcure and dark as they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by himſelf, and as they are neceſſary to be obſerved by us, that we cannot know the meaning of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a further explication: If conſtant and perpetual practice be neceſſary to explain the Law, how could they know it or underſtand it to whom it was firſt given, and who were firſt to obſerve it before there was any ſuch practice to explain it by? This practice muſt begin ſome where, and the Law of Chriſt muſt be known to thoſe who begun it, antecedent to their own practice: There may be great danger if we make <hi>Practice</hi> to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of the
<hi>Law,</hi> and not the <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Practice,</hi> and God's Laws may be very fairly explained away, if they are leſt wholly to the mercy of men to explain them: For thus it was the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who were the great men of old for Tradition, did thereby <hi>reject and lay aſide</hi> the Commandment of God by making Tradition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it contrary to its true ſenſe and meaning. This Principle therefore of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s muſt not be admitted without ſome caution, and though we are well aſſured of conſtant and perpetual practice for Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in one kind, yet the Law of Chriſt is ſo clear as not<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56128:67"/>to need
<hi>that</hi> to explain it, and we may <hi>know what apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains or does not appertain to the ſubſtance of the Sacraments</hi> from the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf, and from the divine Inſtitution of them, as I have all along ſhewn in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>It would have been a great reflection upon the Church, if its Practice had not agreed with the Law of Chriſt, though ſo plain and expreſs a Law ought neither to looſe its force nor its meaning by any ſubſequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; I have ſo great a regard and honour for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, that I do not believe it can be guilty of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Practice ſo contrary to the Law of Chriſt, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind; and I have therefore fully ſhewn, that its Practice has always agreed with this Law, in oppoſition to <hi>de Meaux,</hi> who falſely reproaches the Church with a practice contrary to it; his deſign was to deſtroy the Law of Chriſt by the Practice of the Church; mine is to defend the Practice of the Church as agreeable to, and founded upon the Law of Chriſt, but the Law of Chriſt ought to take place, and is antecedent both to the Churches Practice and the Churches Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: As to Tradition, which was the main thing which <hi>de Meaux</hi> appealed to, I have joyned iſſue with him in that point, and muſt leave it to thoſe who are able to judge which of us have given in the better evidence, and I do not doubt but we may venture the Cauſe upon the ſtrength of <hi>that;</hi> but there is another more conſiderable
<hi>plea,</hi> which is prior to Tradition, and which as <hi>de Meaux</hi> owns,
<note n="†" place="margin">P. 201.</note> 
               <hi>Is the neceſſary ground work</hi> of it, and that is Scripture, or the Command and Inſtitution of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, which is ſo plain and manifeſt, that it may be very well underſtood by all without the help of Tradition; I do not therefore make any manner of exceptions to Tradition in this caſe, onely I would ſet it in its right place, and not found the Law of Chriſt upon Tradition, but Tradition upon the Law of Chriſt, and I am willing to admit it as far as <hi>de Meaux</hi> pleaſes, with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56128:68"/>this reaſonable <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That it does not interprete us out of a plain Law, nor make void any Command of God that may be known without it; I have therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <hi>de Meaux</hi> in all he brings for Tradition and the Practice of the Church, unleſs he will lay ſo great ſtreſs upon that, as to make it null, and ſuperſede a divine Law; nor am I at all concerned in all the inſtances he brings for it out of the
<hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">§. V. §.

It was boldly and openly done indeed by the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> when it owned, <hi>That Christ inſtituted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adminiſtred it to his Diſciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kinds</hi>

               <hi>and that the faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it under both kinds in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church:</hi> Yet to command it under one by its own power and authority, and by its own Prerogative to give a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to Chriſt's Inſtitution; this was done like thoſe that had a ſufficient <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, and were reſolved to let the World ſee they had ſo, and that Chriſt's own Inſtitution was to give way to it; they had not then found out the more ſly and ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubtilties that Chriſt gave the Cup to his Diſciples onely as Prieſts, and made them Prieſts juſt after the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the Bread; this was a late invention found out ſince that <hi>Council,</hi> by ſome more timerous and wary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters who were afraid of ſetting up the Churches Power againſt a Divine Inſtitution; neither did they then offer to juſtifie the Communion in one kind by the Tradition and Practice of the Primitive Church, as <hi>de Meaux</hi> and others have done ſince, but they plainly gave <pb n="129" facs="tcp:56128:68"/>up this, and onely made a late Cuſtom, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards introduced, to become a Law by vertue of their preſent Power, <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> the Inſtitution of Chriſt and the Practice of the Primitive Church to the contrary: Here the Caſe truly lies, though <hi>de Meaux</hi> is willing to go off from it, there muſt be a power in the Church to void a Divine Inſtitution, and to null a Law of Chriſt, which can be no other than an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian power in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, which may by the ſame reaſon take away all the poſitive Laws of Chriſtianity, or elſe Communion in one kind is not to be maintained; and this power muſt be in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar preſent Church, in oppoſition to the Primitive and the Univerſal, or elſe this Communion is not to be maintained in the Church of <hi>Rome: De Meaux</hi> muſt be driven to defend that
<hi>post</hi> which he ſeems to have quitted and deſerted, or elſe he can never defend this half-Communion, which is contrary, as I have proved, and as the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> owns, to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and to the Practice of the Primitive Church. The new Out-work he has raiſed from Tradition, in which he puts all the forces of his Book, and the main ſtrength of his Cauſe; this I have not beat down or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but taken from him; and his cauſe can never hold out upon his own principles of Tradition and the Practice of the Church, which is a very ſtrong batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt it, as I have largely ſhewn; ſo that all that he ſays for Tradition is in vain, and to no purpoſe, ſince this Tradition he pleades for is utterly againſt him, and if it were never ſo much for him, yet no Tradition can take away a Divine Law.</p>
            <p>He ſeems to own, and I think he dare not expreſly deny, that what is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the Sacraments, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the ſubſtance of them cannot be taken away by <hi>Tradition</hi> or the Power of the Church, but he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroys this by making onely
<hi>Tradition</hi> and the<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56128:69"/>
               <hi>Practice of the Church</hi> to determine what is thus eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Sacraments, for if nothing be
<hi>eſſential</hi> but what is made ſo by <hi>them,</hi> and may be known by <hi>them,</hi> then they have a power to make or to alter even the very
<hi>eſſentials</hi> of the Sacraments, which are hereby made wholly to depend upon the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> We are willing to own that nothing is unalterable in the Sacraments, but what is eſſential to them, and that all other <hi>indifferent</hi> things belonging to them, may be altered by the <hi>Church,</hi> or by <hi>Tradition;</hi> but then we ſay that what is <hi>eſſential</hi> is fixt and known by the
<hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and by a <hi>Divine Law,</hi> antecedent to
<hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and if it were not ſo, then there were nothing
<hi>eſſential</hi> in the Sacraments at all, but all would be
<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> and all would depend upon <hi>Tradition</hi> and the
<hi>Churches Power;</hi> and then to what purpoſe is it to ſay, That the Church has power onely in the <hi>Accidentals,</hi> and may alter whatever is not <hi>eſſential,</hi> or belongs not to the ſubſtance of the Sacraments; this onely ſhews that they are aſhamed to ſpeak out, and they dare not but grant with one hand, that which they are forced to take away with another; they dare not openly ſay, That the Church has power over the eſſentials of the Sacraments; but yet they ſay, That there are no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials but what are made and declared to be ſo by the Church: So the ſtreight they are in obliges them in effect to revoke their own conceſſions, and Truth makes them ſay that which their Cauſe forces them to unſay again, and they are put upon thoſe things in their own neceſſary defence, which amount in the whole to a contradiction.</p>
            <p>If the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> can ſhew us that any Divine Inſtitution was ever altered by the Jewiſh or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, or any Law of God relating to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Ceremony was ever taken away by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Practice and Tradition, then he ſays ſomething
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56128:69"/>to the purpoſe, of <hi>Communion in one kind,</hi> but if the many Inſtances which he brings for Tradition out of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> do none of them do this, they are then uſeleſs and inſufficient, they fall ſhort of what they ought to prove, and come not up to the queſtion in hand, but are wholly vain and inſignificant, and to ſhew they are ſo, I ſhall reduce them to theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing heads:</p>
            <p n="1">1. They chiefly relate to the Churches Power in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing and determining ſeveral things which are left indifferent and undetermined by the Law of God; and here we acknowledge the Church to have a proper Power, and that it may oblige even in Conſcience to many things, to which we are not obliged by the Law of God; and may determine many things for the ſake of Peace and Uniformity in Divine Worſhip, which are not ſo preciſely determined by God himſelf. Thus the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church might ſettle the time of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers,</hi> on which their Sabbaths and Feaſts were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, the evening being to them the beginning of the next day; ſo they might appoint alſo the manner of obſerving the new Moons; thus they might alſo ſettle the times of the Three Sacrifices, the <hi>Daily,</hi> the
<hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical,</hi> and the <hi>Paſchal,</hi> when they were all to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the ſame day upon one Altar; and determine which of them ſhould be offered firſt, though God himſelf had not determined it: But could they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any one of theſe Sacrifices which God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, upon a pretence that the other were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent without it? could they have neglected either the New Moons or the Evening-Oblations which God had appointed, becauſe they might appoint what God had not done, namely, the manner of obſerving them? becauſe they could regulate ſeveral things relating to the Law, and neceſſary to the obſervance of it, which God had not determined; could they therefore void<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56128:70"/>the Law it ſelf, or tranſgreſs and violate it in any of thoſe things which God had particularly appointed? Thus the Chriſtian Church may order many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Divine Worſhip, and even to the Sacraments themſelves, which no Law of Chriſt has ordered or determined, as the time, the place, the outward form and manner of adminiſtring them; and yet theſe as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays, <hi>Are abſolutely neceſſary for the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divine Law;</hi> which cannot be obſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome of thoſe circumſtances; thus as to Baptiſm it may appoint it to be performed by ſprinkling or dipping, becauſe neither of thoſe are commanded by the word
<hi>Baptize,</hi> but onely waſhing with Water, as I have ſhewn before againſt <hi>de Meaux,</hi> but to do this in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, becauſe this is commanded, though whether with that form, <hi>I baptize thee,</hi> or <hi>Be thou ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſed;</hi> which is uſed in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Thus as to the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> the Church may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it to be taken kneeling or ſtanding, which was an ancient poſture of receiving it; it may uſe ſuch a form of words in the conſecrating the Elements, and in bleſſing the Bread and Wine, or another, for it is plain, one was not always uſed, and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Apoſtles conſecrated onely with Lord's Prayer</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 63. <hi>ad Syr.</hi>
               </note>. It may uſe ſuch a ſort of Bread and Wine, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for no particular ſort is commanded; but it is neceſſary to bleſs and to give <hi>both,</hi> becauſe
<hi>both</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and both are commanded; and the Miniſters,
<hi>who are the Stewards of the Myſteries of God</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.</note>, theſe alone have the ordinary power of bleſſing and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting them to the people, but they may do this by the hands of the Deacons, or by ſuffering the people to take them and divide them among themſelves: Such things as theſe which <hi>de Meaux</hi> offers to us as great difficulties, are onely indifferent things left undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <pb n="133" facs="tcp:56128:70"/>by the Divine Law, in which the Church has a power to appoint what it thinks moſt proper for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and order, and edification, and thus the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt knots with which he deſigned to entangle us are eaſily reſolved and untied, and yet not any one of the Divine Laws are in the leaſt looſened or diſſolved. One of the greateſt things he urges for the neceſſity of Tradition and the Practice of the Church, is the Baptiſm of Infants, for which he ſays we can produce nothing from Scripture, but muſt be forced to reſolve it wholly into Tradition; as to <hi>that</hi> I am not willing to begin another Controveſie with him here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall onely ſend him to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who proves Infant Baptiſm from Scripture
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellarmin. de Sacram. Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi.</hi> c. 8, 9.</note> as well as from Tradition, and ſays, <hi>It may be clearly gathered from Scripture it ſelf</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamen id &amp; colligitur ſatis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertè ex Scripturis.</hi>
               </note>. But if it were not, does it follow becauſe the Church may make a Law which is not contained in Scripture, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may break a Law which is? and becauſe it may appoint ſome things which God has left indifferent, that therefore it may forbid what he has abſolutely commanded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Other inſtances produced by <hi>de Meaux,</hi> relate not onely to matters Eccleſiaſtical, but to thoſe that were Civil, or at leaſt mixt, and ſo belonging to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Magiſtrate, as the
<hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of Marriage with the
<hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites:</hi> The Civil Magiſtrate was to ſee all poſſible Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done by the one, according to God's own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and it was a commendable act in him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all miſchief that might have come by the other, though this was done without a Divine Precept, by a general Power veſted in the Magiſtrate, or a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and immediate direction, perhaps given by God to <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> But how theſe can any way<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56128:71"/>ſerve <hi>de Meaux,</hi> I cannot imagine, in the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, unleſs he would prove the Magiſtrate not bound to execute the <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> at all, or that the
<hi>Jews</hi> might have diſpenſed with the Law in <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy,</hi> which forbad Marriages with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> becauſe upon the ſame ground and reaſon they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad thoſe alſo with the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and
<hi>Moabites</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some caſes he mentions were excuſed upon the account of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> which when it is notorious and unavoidable, diſpences with a poſitive Law. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s eating the Shewbread, which it was not lawful but for the Prieſts ordinarily to eat, is approyed by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.4. not upon the account of Tradition, or the judgement of the High-Prieſt, but the extream hunger which he and his Companions were then preſſed with, and which made it lawful for them them to eat of the hallowed Bread, when there was no other to be procured: But did this make it lawful afterwards for the High-Prieſt or the Sanhedrim to have made the holy Bread always common to others when there was no ſuch neceſſity? Thus if ſome Chriſtians lived in a Country where it was impoſſible to have any Wine, this might excuſe them from taking the Cup, but does this juſtiſie the making a general Law to take away the Cup when there is no ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for it? and the ſame may be ſaid of many other like inſtances.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In other caſes when a Law was founded upon a particular reaſon, the ceaſing of that made the Law to ceaſe, which was wholly grounded upon it, as in the prohibition of eating Bloud, and things ſtrangled, and Meats offered to Idols, this being to avoid giving any ſcandal to the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time, when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it ceaſed, ſo did the Law; and it is not ſo much Tradition which makes it void, as thoſe general ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56128:71"/>of Chriſt and the Apoſtle, that <hi>nothing which enters in at the mouth defiles the man;</hi> and
<hi>that whatever is ſold in the ſhambles may be eat, without asking any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Jews</hi> defending themſelves upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, on which they were commanded ſo ſtrictly to reſt, it was both
<hi>neceſſity</hi> and the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the Law which made this juſtifiable, and not any Tradition or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſentence of the
<hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> and our Saviour when he blames their ſuperſtitious obſervance of the Sabbath, does not reprove them for keeping it as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or otherwiſe than Tradition had explained it, but contrary to the true reaſon and meaning of it, and to the true mind and will of the Lawgiver.</p>
            <p>As to the Chriſtians changing the Sabbath into the firſt Day of the Week, this was not done by <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but by the
<hi>Apoſtolical Authority;</hi> and whatever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation there may be antecedent to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> for obſerving one day in ſeven, it can neither be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved exactly the Seventh day from the Creation, much leſs that the Chriſtians are under any ſuch obligation now, or I may adde, if they were, that Tradition would excuſe them from a Divine Law.</p>
            <p>All the inſtances which Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> heaps up, are very ſhort of proving that, and though I have examined every one of them, except that pretended <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tradition of Praying for the Dead, which is both falſe and to no purpoſe, yet it was not becauſe there was any ſtrength in them to the maintaining his ſinking Cauſe, but that I might take away every ſlender <hi>prop</hi> by which he endeavours in vain to keep it up, and drive him out of every little <hi>hole</hi> in which he ſtrives with ſo much labour to <hi>Earth</hi> himſelf, when after all his
<hi>turnings</hi> and <hi>windings</hi> he finds he muſt be run down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:56128:72"/>If any inſtance could be found by <hi>de Meaux</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of any Tradition, or any Practice of a Church contrary to a Divine Inſtitution, and to a plain Law of God, they would deſerve no other anſwer to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to it, but what Chriſt gave to the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> in the like caſe: <hi>Why do ye tranſgreſs the commandment of God by your tradition</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Mat.
15.3.</note>? Our Saviour did not put the matter upon this iſſue, Whether the Tradition by which they <hi>explained</hi> the Law, ſo <hi>as to make it of none effect,</hi> was truly ancient and authentic, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to them from their fore-Fathers; but he thought it ſufficient to tell them that it
<hi>made void,</hi> and was contrary to a Divine Law.</p>
            <p>There is no Tradition, nor no Church, which has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver broke ſo plain a Law, and ſo ſhamefully violated a Divine Inſtitution, as that which has ſet up Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in One Kind: the true reaſon why it did ſo was not <hi>Tradition,</hi> no, <hi>that</hi> was not ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at firſt for the doing of it, but onely ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary dangers and inconveniencies, which brought in a new cuſtom contrary to ancient Tradition: Theſe were the onely things inſiſted on in its defence at firſt,
<hi>the danger of ſpilling the Wine, and the difficulty of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in ſome places, and the undecency of Laymens dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their Beards in it:</hi> Theſe were the mighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. which <hi>Gerſon</hi> brought of old againſt the <hi>Hereſie,</hi> as he calls it, of <hi>Communicating in both Kinds</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tractatus Magiſtri Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis de Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon contra hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſin de com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munionae Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum ſub utra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſpecie.</hi>
               </note>; as if it were a new Hereſie to believe that Wine might be ſpilt, or that men wore Beards, or as if the Sacrament were appointed only for thoſe Countreys where there were Vines growing. <hi>De Meaux</hi> was very ſenſible of the weakneſs and folly of thoſe pretences, though they are the <hi>pericula</hi> and the <hi>ſcandala</hi> meant by the Council of
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> and therefore he takes very little notice of them, and indeed he has quite taken away all their arguments againſt the particular uſe of the Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56128:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>he all along pleades for <hi>either</hi> of the Species, and owns it to be indifferent which of them ſo ever is uſed in the Sacrament: But I have ſhewn that both of them are neceſſary to make a true Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both are commanded, and both inſtituted, and both of them equally belong to the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and ſo to the eſſence of it, and both are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily neceſſary to the receiving the inward Grace and Vertue of the Sacrament, becauſe that is annext to both by the Inſtitution, and cannot warrantably be expected without both.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, <hi>Communion in One Kind</hi> is both contrary to the Inſtitution and to the Command of Chriſt, and to the Tradition and Practice of the Primitive Church grounded upon that Command, and is no leſs in it ſelf than a ſacrilegious dividing and mangling of the moſt ſacred Myſtery of Chriſtianity, a deſtroying the very Nature of the Sacrament, which is to repreſent the Death of Chriſt, and his Blood ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his Body; a leſſening the ſignification and reception of our compleat and entire ſpiritual Nouriſhment, whereby we are Sacramentally to eat Chriſt's Body and drink his Bloud; an unjuſt depriving the People of that moſt pretious Legacy which Chriſt left to all of them, to wit, His Sacrificial Bloud which was ſhed for us, and which it is the peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtians thus myſtically to partake of; and laſtly, a robbing them of that Grace, and Vertue, and Benefit of the Sacrament which belongs not to any part, but to the whole of it, and cannot ordinarily be received without both kinds: O that God would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put it into the hearts of thoſe who are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, not to do ſo much injury to Chriſtians and to Chriſtianity; and not to ſuffer any longer
<hi>that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty,</hi> which is the great Foundation of all Spiritual Grace and Life, to be tainted and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56128:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>with ſo many corruptions as we find it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other parts of Chriſtianity! And O that that bleſſed Sacrament which was deſigned by Chriſt to be the very Bond of Peace, and the Cement of Unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Chriſtians, and to make them <hi>all one Bread and one Body,</hi> may not by the perverſneſs of men and the craft of the Devil, be made a means to divide and ſeparate them from each other, and to break that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Charity which it ought to preſerve!</p>
